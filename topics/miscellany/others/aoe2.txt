# Age of Empires II tips

## Lessons learned

Use your army/resources
Beware of backstabs (to be attacked by A while attacking B)
Don't let others build military buildings near your base (avoid surprise/focused attacks)
Stablish early alert systems (watch towers)
Petards can help enter a single-wall base quickly
Have alternative military building for building alternative types of units to adapt to enemy units
Check territories and markets of eliminated players (somebody could take advantage)
Grow fast: multiple TCs
Multiple simultaneous attacks

## Tatoh basics

**Golden rules**:

- Don't stop producing villagers (the more villagers, the more resources). Every time you have 50 food, create a villager.
- Villagers should be working all time.
- Spend all your resources (unless we reached maximum population or want to get next age).

**Timing**: Time spent by a villager (vill) to get 10 resources is ~30 seconds average.

- A vill costs 50 food and takes 25 seconds.
- 5 vills getting food take 30 seconds to get 50 food.
- Thus, 6 vills getting food ensure the town centre (TC) can produce vills non-stop.

**Food sources**:

- __Fruits__: Slow to extract.
- __Domestic animals__ (sheep, goat, cow, buffalo): Faster than fruits. Taken to TC with villager. About 6 or 8, depending on the animal.
- __Small wild animals__ (deer, ostrich, zebra): Faster than domestic animals. Taken to TC with scout.
- __Big wild animals__ (boar, rhinoceros, elephant): Faster than domestic animals. Taken to TC with villager's hit-and-run.

**Key shortcuts**: Use them to quickly select options in the villager's and any building's menu.

**Dark Age**:

- 6 vill to food (one sheep at a time)
- 4 vills to wood
- 1 vill > Hunt the boar (we should have ~11 vills at minute 3).
- 1 vill > Build 2 houses and get fruits
- 1 vill > Build mill and get fruits
- 4 vills to fruits
- Go Feudal with 22 vills

Note: If you get food shortage for villagers creation, force hunters to unload food. Villagers looting the boar get food faster than from sheep, but load a bigger amount. 

**Game speed**: Slow (x1.0), casual (x1.5), normal (x1.7), fast (x2.0). Normal speed is used in competitives matches.

**Control groups** (`Ctrl` + `number`): Used for units and buildings. One click selects the group. Two clicks move camera to the group.

**Boar hunt**:
- __Normal way__: One villager attracts the boar to the TC and the other villagers (~6) kill it. Garrison unit with `T` or `Alt`.
- __Advanced way__: One villager attracts the boar to the TC, the others (~6) garrison in the TC, the TC shoots twice, then they ungarrison, and kill it. Even better, if TC's meeting point (`T`) is at the boar, the villagers will attack it immediately after ungarrisoning them.

**Commands queue**: Use `Shift` to give a unit a concatenated queue of commands (construct building, get resource, get relic, attack unit).

**Feudal age strategies**: Rush of scouts.
