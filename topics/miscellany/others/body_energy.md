## Energy sources

No matter the energy source, the end goal is to produce ATP, the molecule your cells actually use for energy. Any energy product (glucose, fatty acids, ketones, amino acids...) ultimately feeds into the mitochondria to make ATP. The body has 3 main sources of energy:

- **Carbohydrates** (4 calories/gram):
  - __Broken down into__ glucose, which is convertible to ATP (used directly by cells), lactate (under low oxygen), and glycogen (storage form of glucose).
  - __Stored as__ **glycogen** primarily in muscles (to fuel activity) and liver (to maintain blood sugar levels). Quickly available. Excessive carbs are converted to fat.
  - __Usage__: Preferred energy source for high-intensity, short-duration activities, or when carbs are available. When glycogen is available, your body will use it before switching to fat.

- **Fats** (9 calories/gram):
  - __Broken down into__ fatty acids (convertible to ATP and ketones in the mitochondria), and glycerol (convertible to glucose in the liver).
  - __Stored as__ triglycerides (1 glycerol molecule + 3 fatty acids) in adipose tissue. Slower availability than glycogen.
  - __Usage__: The body shifts to fat burning (lipolysis) when glycogen stores are low (like during fasting, long-duration exercise, low-carb diet, rest). Ketones (water-soluble fat-based alternative to sugar) can be used by the brain (it cannot use fatty acids), heart, and muscles for energy.

- **Proteins** (4 calories/gram):
  - __Broken down into__ amino acids, which are convertible to ATP, glucose, and fat (if in surplus).
  - __Stored as__ muscle tissue mostly. Excessive proteins are converted to fat.
  - __Usage__: Used as a last resort. Low or unavailable carbs and fat can make your body convert amino acids into glucose or energy (gluconeogenesis). This process is inefficient (protein is harder to convert into energy than carbs or fat), leads to muscle loss, and may stress the liver and kidneys (to process nitrogen produced during protein metabolism).

The body shifts and blends energy usage continuously. In general, when carbs are available, they're used. When glycogen stores are low, fat is burned. And when carbs and fat are low or unavailable, proteins are used. However, when ATP demands are low (at low-intensity activities: resting, walking...) fat is preferred (there's no rush for energy). But after a carbs-heavy meal, insuline rises and your body temporarily prefers glucose.


## Energy usage

The body switches between energy sources based on availability, intensity of activity, and energy demand. It blends and shifts energy usage continuously, favouring what is more available and appropriate.

- At rest (fast or fed): ~20-30% from glucose. ~60-80% from fat. Minimal protein (unless you're fasting long-term).
- During exercise: Depends on the intensity:
  - Low (walking...): Mostly fat.
  - Moderate (jogging...): Mix of fat + carbs.
  - Hight (sprint, lifting...): Mostly carbs.
  - Very long or fasted exercise: Mix of fat + protein + some carbs.
- During fasting or low-carb diets:
  - 0-24 hours: Glycogen + fat.
  - 24-48 hours: Fat increases, and protein starts.
  - 2-5 days: Fat + ketones + moderate protein use.
  - 5+ days: Mostly fat + ketones + moderate protein use unless very lean.

Protein use kicks in when: glycogen is low, fat burning alone cannot meet glucose needs and/or fat stores are critically low. Even during fasting, the body tries to spare protein and shift to ketones to protect muscle mass.

You start burning more fat as glycogen goes down or intensity stays low. Protein is used significantly when carbs and fat aren't enough.

## Glycogen storage

- **Liver glycogen**: ~100-120 grams (for maintaining blood glucose).
- **Muscle glycogen**: ~300-500 grams (used locally by muscles during activity).
- **Total glycogen**: ~400-600 grams (~1600-2400 calories worth).

Glycogen is stored with water (~3-4 grams of water per gram of glycogen) so, when it's depleted, you also lose water weight.

This storage can be depleted during

- Intense exercise (~60-90 minutes): Sprint, high intensity training (HIIT), heavy lifting.
- Moderate exercise (~2-3 hours): brisk walking, light jogging.
- Calorie deficit (12-24 hours): Fasting (overnight, intermittent...), low-carb/keto diet.

Many people rarely enter a state of meaningful fat burning, especially in modern lifestyles, due to regularly consumed carbohydrate-rich foods, little physical activity, eating frequently, and shorter than optimal sleep (fat burning ramps up during overnight fasts). Thus, glycogen stores may never get a chance to be fully depleted. Eating enough calories to meet the daily energy needs (no calorie deficit) prevents significant fat burning.


## Low glycogen effects

Full glycogen storage makes you feel physically and mentally energized, lets you recover more quickly from exercise, and provide fast fuel access to brain, muscles, and nervous system.

Depleted glycogen storage, however:

- if you're not used to switching to fat/ketones, can make you feel physical fatigue, mental fog, mood changes, and hunger or cravings.
- if you're fat-adapted, can make you feel steady energy (even when glycogen is low), and your body can switch to fat and ketones without crashing.

Fat is a "slow fuel" and your body needs to be trained to access it efficiently. Most people (not fat-adapted) are not good at burning fat quickly enough to meet energy demands when glycogen runs out, so there's a temporary energy gap that make them tired.


## Fat storage

Fat has unlimited storage available. Depleting fat stores is rare unless you're extremely lean (<4-5% body fat for men, or <10-12â‚¬ for women). This can produce extreme exhaustion, muscle breakdown (protein is used as energy), impaired brain function (ketones drop, and there's not enough glucose), organ damage, and even death from energy starvation. Most people have enough fat to fuel weeks, even months, of survival.


## Weight loss

**Depleting glycogen** makes you lose weight quickly initially, though it's not fat loss but glycogen and water loss. We store ~400-600 grams of glycogen, which is stored with 3-4 times more water (~1400-2100 g), which weights **~1.8-2.7 kg** total. Eating carbs again can refill glycogen and regain that water weight quickly.

Losing **1 kg of body fat** requires an energy deficit of **~7700 kcal** (commonly accepted value). One gram of pure fat contains ~9 kcal, but body fat (adipose tissue) is ~87% fat, with the rest being water, proteins, and cellular material. However, as you lose weight, your metabolism may slow slightly, so your daily calorie needs drop.


## Sugar

Reducing or eliminating **added sugars** is almost always beneficial (stabilized energy, improved insulin sensitivity, lower diabetes risk, fat loss, better skin, lower inflammation, fewer cravings over time, improved focus and mood once you adjust). The body doesn't need added sugar to be healthy, it can make all the needed glucose from carbs (and protein, if necessary).

Removing sugar intake, if you've been consuming sugar daily, can produce temporary withdrawal symptoms (fatigue, irritability, mood swings, headaches, cravings, trouble concentrating). They usually last from 2-7 days until the body rebalances. After that, things usually get easier and better.

**Natural sugars** (fruits, vegetables, dairy) are fine for most people. They come with fibre, nutrients, and slower digestion, so they don't spike your blood sugar the same way candy or soda does.
