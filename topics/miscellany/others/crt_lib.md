# C Runtime Library (CRT)

The C runtime library (CRT) is a library that provides routines for programming tasks such as string handling, file I/O, memory allocation, etc. There are four main choices for linking CRT to your project (in project's Properties > **Configuration Properties > C/C++ > Code Generation > Runtime Library**):

1. **Multi-threaded (/MT)**
2. **Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd)**
3. **Multi-threaded DLL (/MD)**
4. **Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MDd)**

- **/MT and /MTd**: The runtime library code is included in your library. This can be useful when deploying to systems where you cannot guarantee the presence of the appropriate CRT DLLs, or when you want to avoid version conflicts with other applications.
- **/MD and /MDd**: The runtime library is shared as a DLL, which can reduce the size of your library and avoid embedding multiple copies of the runtime code in different modules. However, you must ensure that the correct version of the runtime DLL is available on the target system.

### Recommendations

- **For Static Libraries**: Use **/MT** (or **/MTd** for debug builds) to make your static library self-contained, which simplifies deployment and avoids runtime dependencies.
- **For Applications**: Use **/MD** (or **/MDd** for debug builds) to benefit from shared runtime libraries, which can reduce the overall size of your application if multiple modules or applications use the same runtime DLLs.

When working with different projects and libraries, it's important to be aware of the runtime library settings, as mismatching runtime libraries can lead to various problems. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

When **linking a static library** (compiled with `/MT` or `/MTd`) to a project:

- **Same Runtime Library**: If both the library and the project use the same runtime library (e.g., both use `/MT`), they will share the same runtime environment, and there should be no issues.
- **Different Runtime Libraries**: If the static library and the project use different runtime libraries (e.g., the library uses `/MT` and the project uses `/MD`), this can cause problems because each runtime maintains its own state, such as heap management, which can lead to memory corruption, mismatched allocators/deallocators, and other undefined behaviours.

When **linking a dynamic library** (compiled with `/MD` or `/MDd`) to a project:

- **Same Runtime Library**: If both the dynamic library and the project use the same runtime library (e.g., both use `/MD`), they share the runtime DLL, ensuring consistent runtime behaviour.
- **Different Runtime Libraries**: If the dynamic library and the project use different runtime libraries, this can lead to the same issues as with static libraries, but with added complexity since the runtime DLLs might conflict.

**Consistency**: Ensure that all projects and libraries in your solution use the same runtime library settings. This avoids runtime conflicts and ensures consistent behaviour across your application.

**Dependencies**: Be aware of dependencies and ensure that third-party libraries are compiled with the same runtime settings. If a third-party library is not available in the desired runtime version, consider recompiling it or adjusting your project settings to match.

**Debug vs Release**: Ensure that debug builds of your projects and libraries use the debug runtime (`/MTd` or `/MDd`), and release builds use the release runtime (`/MT` or `/MD`).

Using consistent runtime libraries across your projects and libraries is crucial to avoid runtime issues. Inconsistent runtime settings can lead to subtle bugs, crashes, and undefined behaviour. Always ensure that all components of your application are built with the same runtime library settings in Visual Studio.
