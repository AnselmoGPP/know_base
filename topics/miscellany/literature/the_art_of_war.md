## Laying plans

The art of war is governed by 5 constant factors that determine the conditions obtaining in the field. Knowing them will bring victory; not knowing will bring failure.

- **Moral law**: This cause the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives or any danger.
- **Commander**: Wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage, strictness.
- **Method and discipline**: Marshalling of the army in subdivisions, graduations of rank among officers, maintenance of roads used for supplying the army, control of military expenditure.
- **Heaven**: Night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.
- **Earth**: Great and small distances, danger and security, open ground or narrow passes, chances of life and death.

Therefore, when determining the military conditions and forecasting victory and defeat, make a comparison like this:

- __Moral law__: Which sovereign is imbued with the moral law?
- __Commander__: Which general has most ability?
- __Method__:
  - Which army is stronger?
  - Which side has officers and men more highly trained?
  - Which side has greater constancy in reward and punishment?
- __Discipline__: Which side enforces discipline more rigorously?
- __Heaven and earth__: Which one has the advantages derived from heaven and earth?

While following these counsels, avail yourself also of any helpful **circumstances** over and beyond the ordinary rules. If circumstances are favourable, one should modify one’s plan.

All warfare is based on **deception**. When we are able to attack, we seem enable. When using our forces, we seem inactive. When we are near, we make them believe we are far. When far, we make them believe we are near.

Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder and crush him.

If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is stronger, evade him.

If he is choleric, irritate him. Pretend to be weak so he grows arrogant.

If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.

Attack where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.

These devices must not be divulged beforehand. The general who wins makes many calculations beforehand.


## Waging war

If the fight goes on for a long time, men’s weapons will grow dull and their ardour will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength. If the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain and the treasure will be spent. At this point, the enemy will take advantage of your extremity; and no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.

It’s not clever to get involved in long delays. Countries don’t benefit from prolonged warfare. Pursue victory, not lengthy campaigns.

The skilful leader doesn’t rise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice. Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy so the army has enough food for its needs. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.

The proximity of an army increases prices, which causes people’s substance to be drained away. After this, the peasants will be afflicted by heavy exactions. People gets poorer while government expenses increase due to the war effort.

A wise general forages on the enemy. One cartload of enemy’s provisions is equivalent to 20 of one’s own.

In order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger by rewarding them. If some chariots have been taken from the enemy, reward who took the first one, and use the chariots against the enemy. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept. Use the conquered foe to augment your own strength. 

On the leader of armies depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.


## Attack by stratagem

It’s much better to take the enemy’s country whole and intact than shattering and destroying it. It’s better to capture the enemy’s troops than destroying them. Hence, supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting, instead of fighting and conquering in all your battles.

From best to worse, the best options are:

- Balk enemy’s plans (highest form of generalship).
- Prevent the junction of enemy forces.
- Attack enemy’s army in the field.
- Besiege walled cities (worst policy).

Don’t besiege walled cities if you can avoid it. This requires too much preparation and time. Also, a general unable to control his irritation will launch his men to the assault, loosing a great portion of them while the town remains untaken.

Attacking by stratagems involves subduing enemy’s troops without fighting, capturing cities without siege, overthrowing kingdoms without lengthy field operations, disputing the empire without losing a man. This way, the victory will be complete.

If our army is:

- 10 vs 1: Surround them
- 5 vs 1: Attack them
- 2 vs 1: Divide your army in two
- 1 vs 1: We can offer battle
- Slightly inferior in numbers: We can avoid the enemy
- Quite unequal: We can flee from them

A small obstinate force may fight, but it will end up being captured by the larger force.

The general is the bulwark of the State. If it is complete, the State is strong. If it’s defective, the State is weak.

A ruler can bring misfortune upon his army in 3 ways:

- By commanding the army to advance or retreat, not realizing that it cannot obey.
- By governing an army likewise he administers a kingdom, not realizing the army conditions. This causes restlessness among the soldiers.
- By employing the army’s officers without discrimination, not adapting to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.

A restless and distrustful army brings anarchy and flings victory away, and trouble will come from other feudal lords.

The essential for victory are:

- Know when to fight and not to fight.
- Know how to handle superior and inferior forces.
- The army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.
- Wait to take the enemy unprepared while you are prepared.
- Have military capacity and don’t be interfered by the sovereign.

If you know your enemy and yourself, you will win all battles. If you only know yourself, you will get the same amount of victories and defeats. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will lose every battle.


## Tactical dispositions

Put yourself beyond the possibility of defeat, and then wait for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.

Security against defeat implies defensive tactics. Ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive. 

Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength. Attacking indicates a superabundance of strength.

A clever fighter not only wins, but excels in winning with ease. He wins his battles by making no mistakes. He puts himself in a position where defeat is impossible, and doesn’t miss the moment for defeating the enemy. The victorious only seeks battle after victory has been won; but the defeated fights first and then looks for victory.

To control success, cultivate the moral law, and adhere to method and discipline.

Military method (each step owes its existence to the previous step):

- Measurement (owes its existence to Earth).
- Estimation of quantity.
- Calculation
- Balancing of chances
- Victory


## Energy

The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it’s a question of dividing up their numbers. This is done by instituting signs and signals.

Withstand enemy’s attack and remain unshaken by using direct and indirect maneuvers.

Increase the impact of your army using the science of weak and strong points.

In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.

Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible, unending, they end but begin anew, they pass away to return once more.

There are only 2 methods of attack, direct and indirect, but both in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers. One leads to another in turn in a never-ending cycle.

The good fighter is terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.

Energy is like the bending of a crossbow; decision is like the releasing of a trigger.

Simulated disorder postulates discipline, simulated fear postulates courage, simulated weakness postulates strength. Disguising order as disorder requires subdivision; disguising courage as timidity requires energy; masking strength with weakness requires tactical dispositions.

To keep the enemy on the move, maintain deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. Sacrifice something that the enemy may snatch at it. Hold out baits to keep him on the march, and then wait for him with a body of men.

Pick out the right men and use combined energy, and you won’t require too much from individuals. The energy developed by good fighters is as the momentum of a rolling stone going down a mountain.


## Weak points and strong

Impose your will on the enemy, but don’t allow his will to be imposed to you. Holding out advantages to him may cause him to approach. Inflicting damages to him make him impossible to draw near. If the enemy is relaxed, you can harass him; if well supplied, you can starve him out; if encamped, you can force him to move. Appear at points where he must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.

The first one to arrive to the field waits for the enemy and is fresh for the fight. The second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.

An army may march great distances without distress if it marches through country where the enemy is not.

You will succeed in your attacks if you only attack undefended places. You can be safe if you hold positions that cannot be attacked. Make the enemy don’t know what to defend nor what to attack.

Your advance may be irresistible if you attack the enemy’s weak points. Your retreat may be safe from pursuit if you move faster than the enemy. We can force the enemy to engage by attacking some place that he will be obliged to relieve. We can prevent the enemy from engaging us by throwing something odd and unaccountable in his way.

Learn to be invisible and inaudible. Discover enemy’s dispositions while you remain invisible. The enemy must be divided while you keep your forces concentrated, so you can attack few enemies with many men. The enemy must not know the spot where we intend to fight, for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at different points, distributing and dividing his forces. If the enemy has to strengthen one sector, he will weaken another; if he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be weak everywhere. Knowing the place and time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from great distances for fighting; otherwise, our forces will stay separated.

Even if the enemy is stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots. Compare his army with your own, so that you may know where strengths are abundant or deficient.

Conceal the tactical dispositions, and you will be safe from spies and wise brains.

Avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak. Don’t repeat the tactics that gained you a victory, but let them adapt to the circumstances. Adapt your tactics in relation to your opponent. Produce victory out of the enemy’s own tactics.


## Maneuvering

The general receives his commands from the sovereign. After concentrating your forces, blend and harmonize its elements before pitching the camp.

Then comes tactical maneuvering, where the difficulty consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain. The art of maneuvering is based on the artifice of deviation, which will make you reach the goal before the enemy. He who knows it better will conquer.

Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.

If, in order to get and advantage by outmaneuvering the enemy, you…

… set a fully equipped army in march, the chances are that you will be too late.
… detach a flying column, you sacrifice its baggage and stores.
… order your men to make forced marches without rest, covering a distance of 100, the leaders of your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy. Many men will fall behind and 1/10 of your army will reach the destination.
…  order them to march a distance of 50, you will loose the leader of the first division and 1/2 of your army will reach the goal.
… order them to march a distance of 30, 2/3 of your army will arrive.
Without a baggage-train, provisions or bases of supply, and army is lost.

Don’t make the army march unless you are familiar with the face of the country (mountains, forests, pitfalls, precipices, marshes and swamps). We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.

Don’t enter into alliances until being acquainted with the designs of your neighbors.

Practice dissimulation and you will succeed. Let the circumstances decide whether to concentrate or divide your troops. Be as fast as the wind, and as compact as a forest. Raid and plunder like fire, and be immovable as a mountain. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable when you move, and fall like a thunderbolt. Ponder and deliberate before you move. The artifice of deviation will make you win.

When plundering a countryside, divide the spoil amongst your men. When capturing new territory, divide it for the soldiery.

Art of handling large masses of men: On the field, gongs and drums are best for communicating; and banners and flags (or signal-fires at night) can be used for clearly seeing objects. With this, you can influence the ears and eyes of your army, and the host can form a united body focused on one particular point.

Art of studying moods: Avoid an army when its spirit is keen, but attack it when it is sluggish and inclined to return.

Art of retaining self-possession: Be disciplined and calmed to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy.

Art of husbanding one’s strength: To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while he is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while he is famished.

Art of studying circumstances: To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm confident array.

Art of warfare: Don’t advance uphill against the enemy, nor oppose him when he comes downhill. Don’t pursue an enemy who simulates flight, don’t attack soldiers whose temper is keen. Don’t swallow bait offered by the enemy. Don’t interfere with an army that is returning home. When surrounding an army, leave an outlet free. Don’t press a desperate foe too hard.


## Variation in tactics

The general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces.

Don’t encamp in a difficult country. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Don’t stay in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, resort to stratagem. In desperate positions, fight.

There are roads that must not be followed, armies which must not be attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, sovereign’s commands which must not be obeyed.

The general who understands the advantages of variation of tactics/plans knows how to handle his troops. He who doesn’t, cannot turn his knowledge of the configuration of the country to practical account, nor make the best use of his men.

The wise leader plan’s considers advantage and disadvantage. This way, we may accomplish the essential part of our schemes. If, in the midst of difficulties, we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may prevent misfortunes.

Reduce the hostiles chief by damaging them, making trouble for them, keeping them engaged, holding out specious allurements, and making them rush to somewhere.

Rely not on the likelihood of the enemy’s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the change of him not attacking, but on the fact that we made our position unassailable.

Five dangerous faults may affect a general. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these faults:

Recklessness: Leads to destruction.
Cowardice: Leads to capture.
Hasty temper: Easy to provoke by insults.
Delicacy of honor: Sensitive to shame.
Over-solicitude for his men: Exposes him to worry and trouble.
