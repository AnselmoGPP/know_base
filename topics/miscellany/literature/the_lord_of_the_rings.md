## The Silmarillion

### Ainulindalë (The music of the Ainur)

At the beginning, there was Eru. He created the Ainur. Eru proposed 3 themes and the ainur sang 3 songs based on them. However, Melkor, the most powerful and knowledgeable ainur, didn't stick too much to the themes and the songs ended up discorded. These songs went out into the Void and created a world globed amid the Void (Eä) (universe). Eru gave light to Eä by putting the Flame imperishable at the center of it. The ainur could see Eä and its history unfolded before them, and saw Elves and Men living in this world (Eru himself introduced them in the third theme). Some of the ainur loved what they saw and decided to descend to Eä to shape it for the good of the elves and men, while the others stayed with Eru in the Timeless halls. The descended ainur were called Valar. Some of them were Ulmo (water), Manwë (airs and winds), Aulë (the fabric of Earth) and Melkor (he secretly desired to subdue elves and men).

They descended at the beginning of times of Eä, when elves and men didn't still exist, and spent a long time preparing Eä for them. However, Melkor wanted to dominate Eä and the First battle of the Valar took place.

The elves call Eru, Ilúvatar, and both elves and men are called Children of Ilúvatar. The region of Eä where the Children are meant to live is Arda.

Notes about Eä:

- __Void__ (Kúma): Night without form or time in which Eä is set.
- __Eä__ is the universe. All that was created by the Ainur's music.
- __Arda__ is the specific flat world within Eä, equivalent to Earth.
- __Middle-earth__ is a part of Arda, the north-western region of the world.
- __Walls of the world__ (Ilurambar) is a globe enclosing Arda and separating it from the Void. The only opening is the Door of Night.
- __Encircling sea__ (Ekkaia, Vaiya): Huge ocean surrounding Eä.
- __Ilmen__: Upper atmosphere. It only existed above Arda itself. This air was breathed by the Valar in Aman. Later on, starts are placed here, and even the sun and moon pass through Ilmen on their way around the world, going down the Chasm of Ilmen (gap between Ekkaia and the Edge of the World) on their way back.
- __Vista__: Inner atmosphere. This air is what was breathed in Middle-earth. It lays between Aman and the Land of the Sun (East)

### Valaquenta (History of the Valar)

Ilúvatar created the Ainur, and they made great music before him. From this music, the world Eä began, and Iluvatar showed the ainur a vision of its history and beauty. Some ainur fell in love with Eä, so Ilúvatar made it real, set it amid the Void, and put the Secret fire (Flame imperishable) at its heart. Some ainur entered into Eä at the beginning of Time, and their task was to shape the world and make real what they saw in the vision. The descended ainur were called Valar by the elves, and Gods by men. The greatest valar were:

Valar kings (Valar):

- Manwë: Lord of Arda (specially, winds and clouds). King of Valars. Second most powerful valar. He understands most clearly Ilúvatar purposes.
- Ulmo: Lord of the waters. Third most powerful valar.
- Aulë: Smith and lord of crafts. Little less powerful than Ulmo.
- Oromë: Lord of forests. Hunter of monsters and fell beasts.
- Námo (Mandos): Master of spirits. Keeper of the Houses of the Dead, and summoner of the spirits of the slain. He knows all things that shall be, and saves only those that lie still in the freedom of Ilúvatar.
- Irmo (Lórien): Master of spirits. Master of visions and dreams.
- Tulkas: The greatest in strength and deeds of prowess. He enjoys wrestling and contests of strength. He came last to Arda to help in the first wars with Melkor.

Valar queens (Valier):

- Varda: Lady of the Stars. She knows all the regions of Eä. Spouse of Manwë.
- Yavanna: Queen of the Earth. Lover of all things that grow. Spouse of Aulë.
- Nienna: She has grief and mourns for every wound that Arda suffers by Melkor.
- Estë: Healer of hurts and of weariness. Spouse of Lórien.
- Vairë: Registers all things that have ever been, and saves them in the halls of Mandos. Spouse of Mandos.
- Vána: The Ever-young. Flowers spring and birds sing when she is close. Spouse of Örome. Sister of Yavanna.
- Nessa: Lithe and fleetfooted. Spouse of Tulkas. Sister of Örome.

The Maiar are Valar of less degree, and they help and serve the greatest valars. Their number is unknown by the elves. The most important ones:

- Ilmarë: Handmaid of Varda.
- Eönwë: Banner-bearer and herald of Manwë. The mightiest in arms of Arda.
- Ossë: Vassal of Ulmo. Master of the seas. Washes the shores. Loves coasts and isles. Sometimes, he is too wild.
- Uinen: Vassal of Ulmo. Lady of the seas. Spouse of Ossë. She loves sea creatures and sea weeds. She calms the waves at mariners cries, restraining Ossë wildness.
- Melian: Serves Vána and Estë.
- Olórin: Wisest maia. He learned pity and patience from Nienna. He loves the elves.

The enemies of the Valar and Maiar:

- Melkor: The most powerful valar. Called Morgoth by the elves. He desires the kingship of Manwë and the dominion over the realms of the Valar. He contended with the Valar, and held dominion over most of Arda for long years. He had many maiar by his side, such as Balrogs and Sauron.
- Balrogs: Dreadful scourges of fire.
- Sauron: Old maia of Aulë.

### Quenta Silmarillion (History of the Silmarils)

#### The beginning of days

Eä is the universe created from the Ainur's songs, and the Secret Fire is in its center. It is amid the Void, but is not part of it. There is a region in Eä called Arda (Earth), which is the place provided for the Children to live (a flat world). It is surrounded with the Walls of the Night, which surround the Outer Sea (Ekkaia). It contains different continents like Middle-earth (middle) and Aman (west).

The First War took place before Arda was fully-shaped, and no living things were still in it. Melkor had the upper hand, but Tulkas descended from heavens to help, and Melkor was forced to flee from Arda.

There was peace for a long age. At some point, Varda created the stars. The Valar lived in the Isle of Almaren, in the Great Lake, in Middle-earth. Yavanna planted the seeds she had devised. Aulë wrought 2 mighty lamps for the lighting of Middle-earth, Varda filled them, and Manwë hallowed them. The Valar set them in 2 high pillars, one at the north and one at the south. Plants and beast started to rise up.

Later, Melkor returned to Arda and built Utumno, a stronghold at the north of Middle-earth. Then, by surprise, he destroyed the pillars and spilled the lamps, which destroyed most of the Earth. Then, he took refuge in Utumno. Since Almaren was destroyed, the Valar went to Aman. They fortified Aman's shores by creating the Pelóri mountains (highest of Earth), lived in Valinor (region behind the mountains), and there built the city of Valmar. Near Valmar, Yavanna created the Two Trees of Valinor (Telperion and Laurelin), who casted light and warmth on the region. Manwë set his throne in the Pelóri, at the top of Taniquetil mountain.

####  Aulë and Yavanna

Aulë was impatient, he couldn't wait for the Children to come, and he wanted people to love and to teach, so he secretly created the dwarfs in Middle-Earth (more especifically, the 7 Fathers of the Dwarfs). Ilúvatar allowed their creation, but made them sleep because he wanted the elves to come first.

Aulë told Yavanna what happened and she was glad. But she worried about the fact that dwarfs and Children would dominate or damage her creation, specially the trees, so she asked Manwë about this. With the help of Ilúvatar, Manwë then realized that the Ainur's song included some details he didn't pay attention before: when the Children awake, Yavanna's creations will awake and summon spirits that will be powerful and reverenced. Furthermore, before the Children awake, the Eagles of the Lords of the West will fly.

#### The coming of elves and the captivity of Melkor

Without the lamps, Middle-Earth was dark. But the first living things arose: weeds in the sea, great trees in the earth, and dark creatures in the valleys. Melkor perverted some of these creatures and created evil monsters. The first spirits that adhered with him were called Balrogs. Middle-Earth was dominated by Melkor. He built Angband, a stronghold in the north-western shores of the sea, to resist any assault from Aman. It was commanded by his lieutenant, Sauron.

Elves awoke in the north-east of Middle-Earth, in Cuiviénen, a bay in the Inland Sea of Helcar. Melkor's servants discovered and spied them. Some elves were captured and converted into orcs. Oröme found the elves by chance during one of his huntings, and the Valars decided to make war to free Middle-Earth of evil.

Melkor met the Valar in the north-west of Middle-Earth, but he and his servants were forced to retreat to Utumno. Then, the Valar set a guard over Cuiviénen. Many battles were fought before the gates of Utumno, and the shape of Middle-Earth changed. Melkor was finally captured and cast into prision for 3 ages in the fortress of Mandos, in the west of Aman. However, many evil creatures were dispersed over the world or stayed hidden in caverns and vaults, and Sauron was not found.

The Valar offered the elves to come with them to Valinor. First, 3 elves visited Valinor: Ingwë, Finwë, Elwë. Then, some elves decided to stay (called Avari) and others decided to go (called Eldar):

- The kindred of Ingwë, lord of the Vanyar, friends of Manwë and Varda.
- Most kindreds of Finwë, lord of the Noldor, friends of Aulë
- Most kindreds of Elwë, lord of the Teleri together with his brother Olwë.

The journey took many years. Some elves got lost or turned aside (called Úmanyar) and stayed in Middle-Earth. Avari and Úmanyar were called Moriquendi.

In their way, they crossed the Anduin river, frontier of the west lands of Middle-Earth, and continued through the Misty mountains (reared by Melkor to hinder the riding of Oromë), entering Eriador. Many Teleri, afraid of the Misty mountains, turned aside leaded by Lenwë (called Nandor). The elves continued across Eriador and the Blue mountains, entering Beleriand, the westernmost land of Middle-Earth. They crossed Sirion river and reached the Great Sea between Drengist and the Bay of Balar. Afraid of the sea, many elves withdrew into Beleriand. The Teleri leaded by Elwë, who had stayed behind when crossing the Misty mountains, halted and dwelt a while in East Beleriand, beyond Gelion river.

#### Thingol and Melian

Melian was a maia that dwelt in the gardens of Lórien, in Valinor. When she heard about the elves awakening, she departed to Middle-Earth and filled the silence with her beautiful voice and the voices of her birds.

When the Teleri were resting in East Beleriand, many of the Noldor were staying in the forests of Neldoreth and Region. One day, Elwë was crossing the forest of Nan Elmoth in his way to visit his friend Finwë, when he met Melian by chance. He fell in love with her and, when he took her hand, a spell was laid on him: long years passed before they spoke any word. Elwë's folk couldn't find him, so his brother Olwë took the kingship of the Teleri and continued the journey.

Later, both Melian and Elwë (then called Elu Thingol) became kings of all the Eldar in Beleriand. Their hidden halls were in Menegroth, in Doriath.

#### Eldamar and the princess of the Eldalië

The northernmost part of Middle-Earth was only separated from Aman by a narrow sea filled with grinding ice. That was a difficult path, so Ulmo created an island that moved to the Bay of Balar, where the Vanyar and Noldor embarked, and then took them to Aman. Part of the island remained behind and was called the Isle of Balar.

The Teleri stayed in Middle-Earth because they were far from the sea and didn't hear the summons of Ulmo. They took Olwë as their king. Ossë and Uinen befriended them. Many years later, due to Noldors request, Ulmo decided to take the Teleri to Aman. The Teleri leaded by Olwë embarked to Aman, but some remained in Middle-Earth: the Falathrim (Elves of the Falas. Teleri convinced by Ossë to stay, the first mariners and makers of ships) and the Eglath (Forsaken people. Kinsfolk and friends of Elwë). Ossë convinced the Teleri of Olwë to ask Ulmo to stop the island, and he did so in the Bay of Eldamar, close to Aman. The isle was called Tol Eressëa (Lonely Isle).

Later, when Elwë awoke from his long trance, the Teleri in Beleriand took him as their king.

A valley (Calacirya) was made in the Pelóri, in front of the isle, and the Vanyar and Noldor built there the city of Tirion, the first city of elves. While quarrying in the hills after stone, the Noldor first discovered the earth-gems. Finwë, king of the Noldor, had 3 sons, who in turn had many sons:

- Fëanor (skillful in word and hand): Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, Amras.
- Fingolfin (strong and valiant): Fingon, Turgon, Aredhel.
- Finarfin (fair and wise): Finrod/Felagund, Orodreth, Angrod, Aegnor, Galadriel.

The Teleri dwelt in Tol Eressëa for a long age, but they finally decided to move to Aman. Ulmo sent Ossë to teach them ship-building so they could sail to Aman. In Aman, they built the city of Alqualondë in the north shores of Eldamar. Later, the Vanyar decided to move closer to the Valar: to Taniquetil and Valinor. Ingwë was considered the High King of all Elves; Finwë, the king of Tirion; and Elwë, the king of Alqualondë.

#### Fëanor and the unchaining of Melkor

Fëanor's mother (Míriel) died giving birth to him. Fëanor discovered how to make great gems. He also learned how to make things in metal and stone, and explored Aman. His father, Finwë, took a second wife (Indis, a Vanya) with whom he had 2 children: Fingolfin and Finarfin. But Fëanor didn't love much her, nor his sons.

Three ages had passed since the capture of Melkor, so he was presented in front of Manwë. He sued for pardon and promised to aid the Valar in their works, and Manwë granted him pardon. But inside, he was full of hate and envy, specially towards the Eldar.

#### The Silmarils and the unrest of the Noldor

Fëanor created the silmarills, three unbreakable great jewels made of an unknown material. They look like diamond but are stronger than adamant. They have an inner fire made of light from the Trees of Valinor. 

Secretly, Melkor told the elves about the coming of Men and spread many lies:

- Manwë was keeping them captive so that Men could take control of Middle-Earth because they would be easier to control for them.
- Fingolfin and his sons were plotting to usurp Finwë's leadership and the line of Fëanor.
- The Valar secretly desired to possess the silmarills.
- Fëanor had his father in his hands and intended to kick Fingolfin and Finarfin out from Tirion.

Pride and anger awoke among the Noldor. Fëanor started to speaking openly against his brothers and the Valar. The Valar thought that Fëanor was the cause of the broken peace in Valinor, so they called him for an interrogation. Soon, the malice of Melkor was revealed, and he hid himself so Valar couldn't find him. Fëanor was sentenced to leave Tirion for 12 years, so he and his 7 sons moved to the north, to Formenos (fortress north of Eldamar). Finwë also moved there, so Fingolfin ruled the Noldor in Tirion.

#### The darkening of Valinor

The Valar couldn't find Melkor. He had gone to Avathar, an unexplored territory to the south-east, in the narrow space between the Pelóri and the sea. There was living Ungoliant, hidden in a ravine, in the shape of a giant spider that emits darkness (its origin is unknown, but it's said that she came from the darkness around Arda and is one of the first Melkor corrupted to his service). With the help of Ungoliant, Melkor climbed over the Pelóri and crossed to the other side.

Meanwhile, Valar, Maiar, Vanyar and Noldor were feasting in Taniquetil. In that feast, Fëanor and Fingolfin met and reconciled.

Melkor and Ungoliant hurried to the Trees of Valinor, and Ungoliant consumed them to death, which made Valmar fall into darkness. Then, both continued running to the north and escaped. Oromë and Tulkas almost get Melkor, but they couldn't reach him because he was covered in the darkness of Ungoliant.

#### The flight of the Noldor

In their escape, Melkor and Ungoliant reached Formenos, where Melkor killed Finwë and stole the silmarills (after this, Fëanor called Melkor, Morgoth). Then, they went to Middle-Earth through Helcaraxë (narrow frozen strait linking Aman and Middle-Earth in the north). In Lammoth, both fought each other for the silmarills. Some balrogs hidden in Angband's vaults came to help Melkor and Ungoliant was forced to escape to Nan Dungortheb. Melkor stayed in Angband.

For some time, Ungoliant stayed in Nan Dungortheb and mated other spider-form creatures. Later, leaving her offspring there, she departed to the forgotten south of the world. It's said that she died after devouring herself during her uttermost famine.

Fëanor claimed the kingship of the Noldor and convinced them to leave Aman. His speech was full of Melkor's lies. He didn't trust the Valar, wanted to recover the silmarills, and to create a kingdom in Middle-Earth. Most of them decided to follow him to Middle-Earth in search of new lands, while one tithe stayed. Fingolfin and Finarfin were eager to leave Aman, but decided to follow the Noldor.

The Noldor arrived to Alqualondë and Fëanor asked the Teleri (leaded by Olwë) to join them and asked for their ships. The Teleri refused and tried to convince them to stay in Aman. Fëanor decided to take the ships by force, so a battle took place. The Teleri were soon overcame and the ships were captured. Later, Uinen rose the sea in wrath and wrecked some of them.

The Noldor continued their journey to the north, some by ship and some by land. Finarfin, filled with grief, decided to turn back to Tirion with some of his people, where he was set to rule the remnants of the Noldor in Aman. But his sons continued the journey.

Helcaraxë deemed impassable, but the ships were too few. Then, Fëanor decided to secretly board the ships with all whom he deemed true to him, and leave Fingolfin and his people in Aman. Fëanor reached the firth of Drengist and entered into Dor-Lómin. However, Fingolfin decided to go through Helcaraxë and finally reached Middle-Earth, although some of them died along the way.

#### The Sindar

Melian and Elu Thingol (Elwë) were the kings of all the Eldar in Beleriand. These moriquendi were the Sindar (grey elves). At the end of the first age of the the captivity of Melkor they had a daughter: Lúthien.

During the second age of the captivity, the Dwarves came over the Blue mountains of Ered Luin into Beleriand. They came from 2 cities they had delved in the eastern side of Ered Luin: Gabilgathol/Belegost (north of Mount Dolmed) and Tumunzahar/Nogrod (southward). There was a another city far to the east: Khazad-dûm (at Misty mountains), later called Moria. King Thingol welcomed them, and elves and dwarves traded with each other.

Melian forsaw that peace would not last for ever so, with the help of dwarves, Thingol built Menegroth, a fortress with the shape of a rocky hill over river Esgalduin, between Neldoreth and Region.

Meanwhile, in the darkness, the dark creatures multiplied. During the third age of the captivity, they started to come to Beleriand from the north and the south (orcs, wolf-shaped creatures, etc.). Thingol and the dwarves made weapons to defend themselves.

In the past, the Nandor were leaded by Lenwë down the Anduin river. Some of them reached the river's mouth while others passed by Ered Nimrais and entered Eriador. The coming of the dark creatures made some of them, leaded by the son of Lenwë, Denethor, to cross the mountains into Beleriand. Thingol welcomed them and they dwelt in Ossiriand.

One day, Morgoth and Ungolianth came back to Middle-Earth. The powers of Melian prevented Ungolianth from entering Neldoreth, so she abode long time in Ered Gorgoroth. Morgoth returned to Angband, gathered an army of orcs, and sent it to attack King Thingol. The orcs passed silently into the highlands of the north and suddenly invaded the regions around Menegroth: the east (between Celon and Gelion rivers) and west (between Sirion and Narog rivers).

Thingol asked Denethor for help, and the eastern host of orcs was taken between the armies of the Eldar and defeated north of Andram (First Battle in the Wars of Beleriand). Those orcs that fled north were waylaid by the dwarves from Mount Dolmed. Few orcs returned to Angband. However, the Nandor were light-armed, and Denethor fell in Amon Ereb. The Nandor took no king again and never came to open war again. They kept themselves in wariness and secrecy, and were called Laiquendi (Green elves). Many went north, entered the guarded realm of Thingol, and merged with his people.

The western orc-host was victorious and Thingol withdrew all his people within Neldoreth and Region. Melian fenced this dominion round about with an invisible wall of shadow and bewilderment (the Girdle of Melian) that nobody could pass against her will. This inner land was called Doriath, the guarded kingdom. Only Doriath and the walled havens of the Falas (Eglarest and Brithombar) were free of enemies.

At this time, Fëanor landed in the Firth of Drengist and fired the ships.

#### The sun and moon, and the hiding of Valinor

Nienna and Yavanna tried to save the trees, but all was vain. Before dying, Telperion bore upon a great flower of silver (Moon), and Laurelin a fruit of gold (Sun). Aüle made 2 vessels to hold and preserve their light, and Arda made them fly in the heaven, nearer to Arda than the stars. Two maiar were chosen to guide them through the sky: Arien (sun) and Tilion (moon). They fly from east to west, then go under the Earth and the cycle repeats.

Meanwhile, Fingolfin and his people began their march into Middle-Earth. Morgoth sent dark clouds to hide his land from the sun. He didn't dare to attack Arien, but he sent spirits to attack Tilion, though Tilion defeated them. Morgoth was not as powerful as he used to be because his might was passed into many evil creatures.

In Aman, the Valar raised up the Pelóri even higher, east, north and south, except for the Calacirya, with great precipices in the outer sides. Towers and sentinels were set on the mountains, and a host was encamped upon the plains of Valmar. From north to south, the Enchanted Isles were set, covered by shadows and bewilderment. Hardly any vessel could pass between them because the waves hit rocks shrouded in mist. All those who ever set foot upon the islands were entrapped, and slept until the Change of the World. Therefore, Aman was shut down.

#### The Men

At the first rising of the Sun, Men awoke in Hildórien (eastward regions of Middle-earth). They met Dark Elves and were befriended by them. Morgoth was moreover checked by the Sun, so there was little peril in the lands. Men spread west, north and south. Nobody knows what befall their spirits after death, only Mandos, Manwë and Ilúvatar know.

#### The return of the Noldor

Fëanor and his sons landed in Lammoth, in the Firth of Drengist, and burned their ships. They crossed Hithlum and encamped in the northern shore of the lake of Mithrim. Before their camp was ready, they were attacked by the host of Morgoth (Second Battle in the Wars of Beleriand). Though outnumbered, the Noldor were victorious. The orcs fled and were hunted over the Ered Wethrim mountains and the plains of Ard-galen.

To their aid came the armies that had passed south into the Vale of Sirion and were besieging the Havens of the Falas. But Celegorm, having news of them, waylaid them with part of the Elven-host, coming down upon them out of the hills near Eithel Sirion, and drove them into the Fen of Serech. The battle lasted 10 days and only a handfull of leaves returned to Angband.

Fëanor drew far ahead of the van of his host, knowing nothing about Angband. Seeing this, the enemies turned to bay, and Balrogs came from Angband to aid them. Fëanor and a few friends were surrounded and he was smitten to the ground by Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs. His sons came up with force and saved him, but he died from his wounds shortly after.

Morgoth, acknowledging defeat, and offering terms, proposed a meeting. Maedhros met his emissaries, but he was captured and taken to Angband. Morgoth sent word that he would release Maedhros if the Noldor leave Beleriand, but they didn't trust him. They fortified a great camp in Hithlum.

Meanwhile, the host of Fingolfin arrived to Mithrim after going by the coast and through the Firth of Drengist. At the rise of the Sun, the enemies fled to Angband, and Fingolfin marched there unopposed. Acknowledging the strength of Angband, he returned and made a camp by the northern shores of lake Mithrim. Fëanor's people, in turn, moved to the southern shore.

From Angband, smokes and vapours were made and spread from the tops of the Iron Mountains (immense mountain range in the north of Middle-earth). They covered Hithlum and poisoned the waters of Mithrim. Fingon and Maedhros had been close in friendship, so he dedided to infiltrate alone in search of Maedhros, aided by Morgoth's darkness. He climbed the Thangorodrim (volcano over Angband), looking for a pass into Angband, when he found Maedhros hanging from a precipice. Fingon couldn't reach him, but Thorondor, King of Eagles, came to his aid (eagles had been sent to the north by Manwë to keep watch upon Morgoth). Unable to cut the bond upon Maedhros' wrist, Fingon was forced to cut his hand in order to save him. Then, Thorondor took them to Mithrim. By this deed, the hatred between the houses of Fingolfin and Fëanor was assuaged, and the Noldor were united again under Fingolfin. 

Angband was besieged from west, south and east. Maedhros and his people moved to the region of the Hill of Himring. Caranthir and his people moved to lake Helevorn, and even met dwarves with whom they traded and made an alliance.

Some decades later, after visiting Menegroth, Finrod decided to build a similar fortress, so he built Nargothrond with the aid of dwarves from the Blue mountains. The dwarves made for him the Nauglamír, a necklace of gold with gems from Valinor. There was love between Galadriel and Celeborn, a kinsman of Thingol, so she stayed in Menegroth and learned much from Melian. Turgon, who was living in Vinyamar (Nevrast), yearned for Tirion, so Ulmo showed him the hidden vale of Tumladen, and he planned to build a city there.

Morgoth then sent orcs across Ard-galen and they went through the Pass of Sirion (west) and the land of Maglor (east) (gap between the hills of Maedhros and the outliers of the Blue mountains). While others took care of the scattered bands of orcs strayed in Beleriand, Fingolfin and Maedhros came upon the main host from either side as it was assaulting Dorthonion and utterly defeated it (Third great battle of the Wars of Beleriand). The Noldor couldn't pass through the Iron mountains, so the Siege of Angband was set (it lasted 400 years). Nearly 100 years after the battle, Morgoth sent an army to the north-west and it tried to enter Hithlum, but they were spied and Fingon fell upon them in the Firth of Drengist and drove them to the sea. After 100 more years, Glaurung, the first dragon, was issued from Angband, and the elves at Ard-galen escaped in dismay to Ered Wethrin (the Mountains of Shadow) and Dorthonion. But Fingon and some archers on horseback attacked him, and he fled back to Angband. The next 200 years there was peace and Beleriand prospered.

#### Beleriand and its realms

In the north, Morgoth had in the ages past reared the Iron Mountains, like a fence to Utumno. In the west, behind the mountains, he also built Angband as a defence against attacks coming from Valinor. When he came back to Middle-earth, he lived in Angband because it was not fully destroyed or explored by the Valar during the War of the Powers of the Valar. Beneath the mountains, he made a great tunnel, which issued south of the mountains through a mighty gate. Above and behind this gate, he built Thangorodrim (three great volcanoes). To the south there was the wide plain of Ard-galen.

In Beleriand, the Noldor controlled different regions:

- Fingolfin's people controlled the north-west (Hithlum).
- Finrod and his brothers controlled the south-west (Realm of Nargothrond, and Dorthonion).
- Maedhros and his brothers controlled the north-east (March of Maedhros, Himlad, land between Little Gelion and Greater Gelion, and Lake Helevorn)
- King Thingol controlled Doriath.

Fingolfin's:

To the west lays Hithlum, covered by the clouds sent by Morgoth, and surrounded by Ered Lómin and Ered Wethrin. Fingolfin and Fingon held Hithlum. Most of Fingolfin's folk dwelt in Mithrim, in the shores of Lake Mithrim. Dor-lómin was assigned to Fingon. Their chief fortress was Eithel Sirion, from where they kept watch upon Ard-galen, and their cavalry rode upon that plain even close to Thangorodrim. Nevrast was the realm of Turgon, who lived in Vinyamar, under Mount Taras beside the sea.

Finrod's:

South of Arg-galen, Dorthonion stretched for 60 leagues from west to east. It arises from the plain with gentle slopes and end up in the south with great peaks. Southward, where it looked towards Doriath, it fell suddenly in dreadful precipices. From the northern slopes, Angrod and Aegnor looked out over Ard-galen. They were vasals of Finrod, lord of Nargothrond. In the isle of Tol Sirion, in a narrow vale between Dorthonion and Ered Wethrin, Finrod built Minas Tirith, a mighty watch-tower for controlling the Pass of Sirion. After building Nargothrond, it was given to Orodreth.

From the Pass of Sirion, the river flows south for 130 leagues until reaching the Bay of Balar. The river Narog flows some 80 leagues from the falls of Ivrin until joining Sirion in Nan-tathren. Few folks dwelt south of Nan-tathren, a region of meads. Beyond lay marshes and isles of reed about the mouths of Sirion, and nobody lives in the sands of his delta.

The realm of Nargothrond extends to river Nenning. Finrod was the lord of all elves between Sirion and the sea, save only in the Falas. Círdan was the lord of the Falas, where those who still loved ships lived. Círdan and Finrod were good friends. West of Eglarest, Finrod raised the tower of Barad Nimras, in case Morgoth attacks from the sea. 

Thingol's and surroundings:

From Sirion to Gelion, there are 100 leagues at its widest. Dimbar was an empty land. Nan Dungortheb was a region filled with fear because Ungolianth, who dwelt there a while, had left her offspring, and the waters spilled from there were toxic.

Doriath was the abode of king Thingol, into whose realm none passed save by his will, and Menegroth were upon the southern bank of Esgalduin. Some 25 leagues east form Nargothrond were the Falls of Sirion, where the river fell in a mighty fall and then plunged suddenly underground into great tunnels that the weight of his falling waters delved, and then issued 3 leagues southward through the Gates of Sirion (rocky arches at the foot of the hills).

Andram was a long fall from Nargothrond to Ramdal. From north to south, the land fell suddenly and steeply. Taur-im-Duinath was wild land of tangled forest in which no folk went, save a few Dark Elves wandering.

Green elves':

From the meeting of Little Gelion and Greater Gelion, river Gelion flows for south for 40 leagues before finding his 6 tributaries. River Gelion is twice as long as Sirion before finding the sea, but less wide and full. In Ossiriand, the land between Ered Luin and rivers Ascar, Adurant, Gelion, dwelt the Green-elves.

Maedhros':

The sons of Fëanor dwelt east of Dorthonion, under Maedhros. Their riders passed often over Lothlann, the empty east of Ard-galen. The chief citadel of Maedhros was upon the Hill of Himring. Celegorm and Curufin fortified the Pass of Aglon, a gate unto Doriath, and held it together with Himlad. Maglor was in charge of the regions between Little and Greater Gelion, and a strength of cavalry was held in the plains there. Caranthir fortified the mountains to the east of Maglor's gap and lived beside Lake Helevorn. The Noldor first met the dwarves at Thargelion. Amrod and Amras lived southward, and they came seldom northward.

None of the Noldor went ever over Ered Lindon, while their realm lasted. The Noldor lords were:

- Fëanor (dead)
  - Maedhros: Lord of Himring
  - Maglor: Regions between Little and Greater Gelion
  - Celegorm: Himlad and Pass of Aglon
  - Caranthir: Lake Helevorn
  - Curufin: Himlad and Pass of Aglon
  - Amrod: South-east
  - Amras: South-east
- Fingolfin: Overlord of all the Noldor. Lord of northern Hithlum.
  - Fingon: Lord of Dor-lómin
  - Turgon: Lord of Nevrast
  - Aredhel: Nevrast
- Finarfin: Stayed in Valinor. Lord of Tirion.
  - Finrod: Lord of Nargothrond
  - Orodreth: Minas Tirith (Tol Sirion)
  - Angrod: Dorthonion
  - Aegnor: Dorthonion
  - Galadriel: Stayed in Menegroth

#### The Noldor in Beleriand

Turgon secretely started building the city of Gondolin in the hidden vale of Tumladen. The access to Tumladen was through a deep way under the mountains delved by waters that flowed out to join Sirion (Dry River). After 52 years, the city was finished and Turgon took all his people, a third part of Fingolfin's people, and secretely moved to Gondolin, shutting the gates behind them and leaving Nevrast empty. Nobody knew where they went, and they didn't leave for more than 350 years.

#### Maeglin

Aredhel dwelt in Nevrast and moved to Gondolin with him. After 200 years, she asked Turgon to leave because she wanted to ride in the wide lands and walk in the forests. He appointed 3 lords of his household to ride with her. She wanted to visit the sons of Fëanor, their old friends, so they continued by the north of Doriath, but she got lost in Nan Dungortheb. Her companions looked for her but got attacked by the fell creatures of Ungoliant, so they escaped to Gondolin. Finally, Aredhel arrived to Himlad, but Celegorm and Curufin were not there because they went to visit Caranthir, in Thargelion. She waited for months, but one day she got lost in the dark forest of Nan Elmoth. There was living Eöl, a dark elf from Doriath that was friend of the dwarves.

He saw Aredhel and attracted her with an enchantment towards his house. They met and he took her as his wife. Later, she bore a son: Maeglin. Eöl didn't like the Noldor (they killed and invaded the Teleri) and forbade Aredhel and Maeglin to visit them. Eöl was sometimes invited to Nogrod and Belegost. One day, while Eöl went to Nogrod, Maeglin and Aredhel escaped towards Gondolin. Two days later, Eöl arrived home and, driven by anger, decided to follow them. Aredhel and Maeglin arrived to Gondolin, but closely followed by Eöl who was captured by the guards and brought to Turgon. Nobody was allowed to leave Gondolin once he had seen it, so he was forced to stay. Then, Eöl tried to kill his son with a poisoned javelin, but Aredhel sprang before the dart and died. The next day Eöl was executed.

#### The coming of Men into the West

When 300 years passed after the Noldor arrived to Beleriand, Finrod went hunting with Maedhros and Maglor. He got lost and ended up in Ossiriand, in the upper streams of river Ascar, where he met a group of men leaded by Bëor, the first men to enter Beleriand. Bëor told that there were more men that had crossed the mountains, and others called the Haladin were still in the eastern slopes, and also numerous people were marching west leaded by Marach. Since the Green-elves were troubled with men, Bëor's people took abode in Estolad. After Bëor died, his son Baran took leadership.

Soon after, the Haladin people arrived to Beleriand, but meeting the unfriendship of the Green-elves, they dwelt in Thargelion. A year later, Marach led his people over the mountains and settled south and east of Baran's people, and there was friendship between them. These three groups of men were friends of the Noldor and were called Edain.

Fifty years later some men moved again, this time through the north because the west was blocked by Doriath and the impassable fens of Sirion. Bëor's people moved to Dorthonion. The son of Marach, Aradan, moved with most of his people to Hithlum. Aradan's son, Magor, and many of his people, dwelt a while in the southern slopes of Ered Wethrin. King Thingol didn't allow men to enter into Doriath.

Some men grew discontent of the Eldar and afraid of Morgoth. Bereg (house of Bëor) led a thousand of his people southward. Some of Marach people moved back to Eriador.

Morgoth sent an Orc-raid that came in stealth over Ered Lindon and fell upon the Haladin, in Thargelion. A man named Haldad gathered all the men that he could find and retreated to the angle of land between Ascar and Gelion and built a stockade across from water to water. They were besieged, and Haldad died, together with his son, Haldar, so Haldad's daugther, Haleth, took the lead. They were almost defeated when Caranthir came to the rescue from the north and drove the orcs into the rivers. After this, Haleth led his people to Estolad, then through Nan Dungortheb to Talath Dirnen (the Guarded Plain), where some of them wandered into the realm of Nargothrond, and later she led many of them to the Forest of Brethil. Haleth successor was Haldan, son of her brother Haldar.

Fingolfin gave Hador (son of Hathol, son of Magor) the lordship of Dor-lómin, where Hador moved most of his people. To Boromir (son of Boron, grandson of Bëor) was given the lordship of Bëor's people and the country of Ladros, in Dorthonion.

Groups of Edain and their movements:

- Bëor's people:
  - Bëor leads them through Blue mountains to Estoland
  - Baran (Bëor's son) takes leadership
  - People move to Dorthonion
  - Bereg (house of Bëor) led a thousand (discontent and afraid) people southward
  - Boron (grandson of Bëor) becomes leader
  - Boromir (son of Boron) is given Ladros (in Dorthonion)

- Haladin:
  - They cross Blue mountains and stay in Thargelion
  - Orc raid. Haldad leads the retreat and defense, but he and his son (Haldar) die. Caranthir cames to the rescue
  - Haleth (Haldad's dauther) leads them to Talath Dirnen
  - Haleth moves many to the Forest of Brethil
  - Haldan (son of Haleth's brother, Haldar) becomes leader

- Marach's people:
  - Marach leads them through Blue mountains to East Estolad
  - Aradan (Marach's son) move most people to Hithlum
  - Magor (Aradan's son) move most people to Ered Wethrin
  - Some (discontent and afraid) people move back to Eriador
  - Hathol (son of Magor) becomes leader
  - Hador (son of Hathol) moves most people to Dor-lómin (land given by Fingolfin)

#### The ruin of Beleriand and the fall of Fingolfin

After 455 years since the coming of Fingolfin, when the sixth generation of men after Bëor and Marach were not yet come to full manhood, Morgoth sent forth great rivers of flame from Thangorodrim that covered Ard-galen and killed all life there. Dorthonion and Ered Wethrin held back the fiery torrents. From Angband marched Glaurung (in his full might), Balrogs, and huge armies of orcs. The Battle of Sudden Flame (the Fourth battle) started in winter and ended in spring, and Finarfin's sons suffered the most. The Noldor's fortresses fell. Most of the Grey-elves fled south and forsook the northern war.

Angrod and Aegnor were slain, next to Bregolas, lord of the house of Bëor. Barahir, brother of Bregolas and new lord of the house of Bëor, was fighting near the Pass of Sirion. Finrod, hastening from the south, was surrounded in the Fen of Serech, but Barahir came with some men and saved him. Bregolas returned to Dorthonion, but most of his people fled to Hithlum.

Fingolfin and Fingon tried come to the aid of Finarfin's sons, but their armies were driven back to the fortresses of Ered Wethrin. Hador fell upon the walls of Eithel Sirion defending the rearguard of his lord Fingolfin. Galdor, his son, took the lordship of his father. Hithlum remained unconquered but Fingolfin was sundered from his kinsmen.

The east marches were taken by assault. The Pass of Aglon was forced and Celegorm and Curufin fled south and west to Nargothrond. Maedhros resisted in the fortress of the Hill of Himring, which could not be taken, and even managed to close the Pass of Aglon.

Upon Lothlann, Glaurung passed through Maglor's Gap and destroyed all the land between the arms of Gelion. The orcs took the fortress next to Mount Rerir, and ravaged all Thargelion. Then, they passed over Gelion and came into East Beleriand. Maglor joined Maedhros upon Himring. Caranthir, Amrod and Amras retreated, passed Ramdal, and maintained some strength upon Amon Ereb; and with the aid of Green-elves, no orcs came into Ossiriand nor to Taur-im-Duinath.

With great rage, Fingolfin rode alone to Angband and challenged Morgoth to a single combat. He managed to wound Morgoth several times, but finally was defeated and killed. Fingon took the lordship of the house of Fingolfin and the kingdom of the Noldor, and took his son Gil-Galad to the Havens of the Falas.

Barahir remained in Dorthonion contesting the land with his enemies, but finally that land was taken. The women and children left through the mountains. Some went to Brethil (with the Haladin) and some went to Dorlómin (with Galdor's people). Beren, son of Barahir, alone escaping came hardly into Doriath. The men that stayed fighting were slained one by one.

For two years the Noldor defended the pass about the sources of Sirion and Minas Tirith. Finally, Sauron (greatest servant of Morgoth, who became a sorcerer) took Tol Sirion and Orodreth fled to Nargothrond. Tol Sirion was made a stronghold for Morgoth. Morgoth pursued his foes and took their strongholds one by one. The orcs came down Sirion and wandered from Sirion to Celon rivers, encompassing Doriath.

At this time, the Swarthy Men came first into Beleriand. Some of them were secretly under the dominion of Morgoth. Maedhros gave his friendship to the greatest of their chieftains: Bór and Ulfang. Bór and his sons (Borlad, Borlach, Borthand) followed Maedhros and Maglor. Ulfang and his sons (Ulfast, Ulwarth, Uldor) followed Caranthir.

The orcs reached the Forest of Brethil, which was defended by the Haladin, leaded by Halmir. He asked Thingol, who sent a great force leaded by Beleg. Both destroyed the orcs, who didn't dare to cross the Teiglin river for many years after, preventing the invasion of the kingdom of Nargothrond.

Húrin and Huor (sons of Galdor), who were attending to a feast at Brethil (Galdor and Glóredhel, children of Hador, were wedded to Hareth and Haldir, children of Halmir), fought against the orcs. However, they got cut off and pursued to the Ford of Brithiach were they managed to escape thanks to a mist raised from Sirion river by Ulmo, but they got lost at Dimbar, beneath the walls of Crissaegrim. Thorondor, who spied them, sent two eagles to their aid and they were brought to Gondolin, which no man yet had seen. King Turgon received them and they dwelt as guests in the King’s house. After one year, they asked Turgon to return with their people. They swore to keep the secret about all that they had seen, and Turgon granted their prayer. The eagles took them to Dor-lómin.

Knowing about the end of the Siege, Turgon secretly sent companies to the mouths of Sirion and Isle of Balar to build ships and sail to Valinor to ask for pardon and aid of the Valar. However, no messenger reached Valinor since it was hidden behind sadow, enchantment, and a wild wide sea. Many were lost and few returned.

Morgoth, despite his victories, also suffered great losses, and felt that he had not measured rightly
the strength of the Noldor and Men. He decided to recall the main hosts of the Orcs to Angband to gather a new strength. After seven years since the Fourth battle, he renewed the assault. A great force attacked Hithlum. At the siege of Eithel Sirion, Galdor was slained by an arrow, but his son Húrin (new leader of the house of Hador in Dor-lómin) drove the Orcs with heavy slaughter from Ered Wethrin, and pursued them far across the sands of Anfauglith. 

King Fingon, who was outnumbered, had a difficult time trying to hold back an army coming from the north into the plains of Hithlum. However, the ships of Círdan sailed in great strength up the Firth of Drengist, and in the hour of need the Elves of the Falas came upon the enemy from the west. The Orcs broke and fled, and horsed archers pursued them even into the Iron Mountains.

1.3.19. Beren and Lúthien

Barahir didn't forsake Dorthonion and stayed there. When only 12 companions remained with him, they withdrew and hid in the highlands, by lake Tarn Aeluin. The rumours of their deeds went far and wide, and Morgoth commanded Sauron to find and destroy them. Gorlim, one of the companions, was captured by Sauron and, under torture and false promises, he revealed Barahir's hidding. Then, Gorlim was killed, and the Orcs killed the others in a surprise attack, save Beren (son of Barahir) who was far afield in a espionage mission.

Beren stayed 4 years more in Dorthonion as a solitary outlaw. His deeds were noised abroad and Morgoth set a high price upon his head. Sauron was looking for him with an army. He was pressed so hard that he was forced to flee from Dorthonion. He crossed the dangerous Ered Gorgoroth and the wilderness of Dungortheb, and entered Doriath through the mazes that Melian wove about the kingdom of Thingol. He got lost in Neldoreth, where he met Lúthien, and both fell in love. When Thingol learned about this, he captured Beren and brought it to Menegroth for punishment. However, he finally asked him for a Silmaril from the Iron crown of Morgoth in exchange of Lúthien's hand.

Beren went to the south, through the Fens of Sirion, and climbed above the Falls of Sirion. Then, he went through Talath Dirnen until he was halted by guardian elves and taken to Finrod, at Nargothrond. Finrod knew him, and Beren told him about his mission. Finrod decided to help him, so he gave the crown of Nargothrond to Orodreth and joined Beren with 10 loyal companions. They journeyed beside Narog to his source in the Fall of Ivrin, where they attacked a company of Orcs at night and took their gears and weapons. Disguised as Orcs, they tried to cross the western pass, but Sauron, at Tol-in-Gaurhoth (former Tol Sirion), was suspicious and captured them. He casted them into a pit, but couldn't discover their names or purposes.

Lúthien was worried and asked Melian, who told her where he was. Lúthien resolved to go with him but, Thingol locked her up in a house on a tree, with guards and no ladder, to prevent it. However, she escaped using enchantments: she caused her hair to grow to great length and used it to make a rope, and made the guards sleep.

Celegorm and Curufin were on a hunt with their hounds at the Guarded Plain, near Doriath (Sauron had sent some wolves). Huan was the chief of wolf-hounds following Celegorm, given to him by Oromë at Valinor. He found Lúthien flying under the trees and brought her to Celegorm, who became enamoured of her. Both brothers held her at Nargothrond with the purpose of forcing Thingol to give her hand to Celegorm, so they could become the mightiest princes of the Noldor. They also wanted to let Finrod perish. Orodreth had no power to withstand them, for they swayed the hearts of the people of Nargothrond. However, Huan, who felt the love of Lúthien, led her by secret ways and both escaped.

When they arrived to the bridge of Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Sauron sent wolves (including Draugluin), but Huan killed them all. Then, Sauron himself fought Huan, but was defeated too. He surrendered Tol-in-Gaurhoth to Lúthien and went to Taur-nu-Fuin. Inside, Lúthien discovered that Finrod and his men were death, but Beren and other prisioners were still alive. Then, Huan returned to Celegorm.

Many of these elves returned to Nargothrond. Celegorm and Curufin were perceived as traitors and the hearts of the people of Nargothrond returned to Orodreth, who swore that there should be little love for Fëanor's sons. Then, the two brothers left Nargothrond towards Himring, where Maedhros dwelt. Celebrimbor (son of Curufin) repudiated the deeds of his father and remained in Nargothrond. The two brothers intended to pass through Dimbar and the north marches of Doriath. On their way between the Forest of Brethil and Doriath, they found Beren and Lúthien. They attacked Beren and tried to capture Lúthien, but were defeated with the help of Huan, who forsook the service of Celegorm, so the brothers continued they journey to Himring.

Beren wanted to continue his mission alone and tried to leave Lúthien at Doriath, but she followed him with Huan. They crossed the Pass of Sirion and Anfauglith, and reached the Gate of Angband. It was guarded by a werewolf (Carcharoth, son of Draugluin), but he felt asleep at Lúthien's command. Huan went to seek some help, and Beren and Lúthien crossed the gate. They meet Morgoth in his nethermost hall, and Lúthien sang in front of him in a way that Morgoth and all his court fell asleep. Beren took one silmaril from his crown and both escaped. At the gates, Carcharoth attacked them. Beren tried to stop him but Carcharot bit his hand off and ate the silmaril, which seared his flesh from inside. While the hosts of Morgoth started to wake up, three eagles (from Crissaegrim) came to the rescue and took them to Doriath. During the flight, Lúthien could see the hidden city of Gondolin. Beren took Lúthien back to Thingol who, finally, gave him the hand of Lúthien.

Carcharoth, in his madness, run destroying everything on its way from the north, went over east Taur-nu-Fuin and the sources of the Esgalduin, and entered Doriath. He was getting closer to Menegroth, so Thingol, Beren, Huan, and other elves went to hunt him. Huan managed to kill him, but Beren and Huan died. Later, Lúthien's spirit left her body and fled to the halls of Mandos.

Mandos, moved by Lúthien, went to Manwë, who knew Ilúvatar's will, and offered her two choices: go to Valimar alone, or return as a mortal to Middle-Earth with Beren. She chose the last option.

- ~~Fëanor~~: **Maedhros**, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, Amras.

#### The fifth battle: Nirnaeth Arnoediad

Beren and Lúthien dwelt for a while in Doriath and visited Menegroth. Then, they went to Ossiriand and dwelt in the isle of Tol Galen.

Dior Aranel / Dior Eluchíl / Thingol's heir

Maedros, knowing the deeds of Beren and Lúthien, perceived that Morgoth was not unassailable, so he decided to make a new league against him.

- Maedhros' brothers joined.
- Fingon joined.
- Nargothrond (Orodreth) didn't join (save prince Gwindor, son of Guilin, who joined Fingon forces) due to the deed of Celegorm and Curufin.
- Doriath (Thingol) didn't join (save Mablung and Beleg) due to the malice of Celegorm and Curufin, the threatens received for surrendering the silmaril, and Thingol's desire of keeping the silmaril.
- Elves of the Falas joined Fingon forces.
- The dwarves helped with armed forces and weapons from the smithies of Nogrod and Belegost.
- The men of Bór and Ulfang joined, and even brought more men from the East.
- The men of the house of Hador (from Dor-lómin), leaded by Húrin, and his brother Huor, joined Fingon forces.
- Haldir, son of Halmir, lord of the People of Haleth (from the forest of Brethil), joined Fingon forces.

The plan was to assault Angband from east and west. Maedhros would lead an army from the east. He expected Morgoth to send his armies in answer. Then, following a signal (a firing of a great beacon in Dorthonion), Fingon would issue forth an army from the passes of Hithlum and attack the enemy too, taking him between anvil and hammer. Right before the battle, unsummoned and unexpected, Turgon opened the leaguer of Gondolin and he stationed his forces guarding the Pass of Sirion. Maedhros made the first move and advanced with his army over Anfauglith while Fingon forces waited the signal hidden on the valleys and woods of east Ered Wethrin and Eithel Sirion. 

Morgoth knew about their plans thanks to his spies and sent a force of orcs towards Hithlum. Fingon forces waited for them on the hills, but the orcs had been commanded to draw out Fingon swiftly from his hills by whatever means they could. After some provocations (in front of Eithel Sirion they killed Gelmir, brother of Gwindor and prisioner from the Dagor Bragollach) the host of Hithlum leapt forth from the hills leaded by Gwindor and this company, and swiftly destroy the enemy forces. They advanced until they reached the Gate of Angband. Gwindor and his company burst through the Gate and slew the guards, but they were trapped and slain, save Gwindor who they took alive. Morgoth's main host was issued forward by many secret doors in Thangorodrim. Fingon could not come to their aid and was beaten back with great loss from the walls. Fingon host retreated on the fourth day of the war. Haldir and most Men of Brethil were slain in the rearguard. The fifth day, as night fell, while they were still far from Ered Wethrin, the orcs surrounded the host of Hithlum and a battle started. They fought the whole night until Turgon forces (leaded by the king's guard phalanx) came in the morning to the rescue. Shortly after, they heard the trumpets of Maedhros coming up form the east, and Maedhros forces assailed the enemy in the rear.

Angband was empty now, and there came wolves, wolfriders, Balrogs, and dragons (including Glaurung). However, victory seemed attainable. But they didn't expect the treachery of Men: many Easterlings turned and fled, and Ulfang sons attacked the rear of Maedhros. The traitor's leader, Uldor, was slew by Maglor. The sons of Bór slew Ulfast and Ulwarth, ere they were slain. But Uldor had kept hidden a force of men in the eastern hills, and they attacked the host of Maedhros, which was now assailed from three sides, and it was broken and scattered.

All of Fëanor's sons were wounded, but escaped to the east to Mount Dolmed (Blue mountains) with a remnant of Noldor and dwarves. Azaghâl, Lord of Belegost, was killed by Glaurung. Fingon and Turgon were assailed by a force thrice greater than the force that was left to them. Turgon and Húring were pushed to the Fen of Serech by Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs, who attacked and killed Fingon.

Turgon retreated to Gondolin, through the Pass of Sirion, with his people and such of Fingon's people as could be gathered. Their flanks were guarded by captains Ecthelion and Glorfindel. The remnants of the house of Hador, leaded by Húrin and Huor, protected their retreat. Then, they retreated behind Rivil river, behind the Fen of Serech, to make their last stand. The sixth day, all of them died, save Húrin that was captured, as Morgoth commanded. Before Morgoth, Húrin defied and mocked him, and Morgoth cursed Húrin, Morwen, and their offspring.

The realm of Fingon disappeared. The sons of Fëanor took a wild and woodland life beneath the feet of Ered Lindon, mingling with the Green-elves of Ossiriand. Some few Halading yet dwelt in Brethil leaded by Handir, son of Haldir. Morgoth sent the Easterlings that served him to Hithlum. Orcs and wolves went freely through all the north, and came ever further southward into Beleriand, even as far as Nan-tathren and the borders of Ossiriand. Doriath remained, and Nargothrond was hidden.

The next year, Morgoth sent great strength to Hithlum and Nevrast. Then, they went south, ravaged all the Falas, and besieged and destroyed Brithombar and Eglarest. The tower of Barad Nimras was cast down. And most Círdan's people were slain or enslaved. But some escaped by sea on a ship with Círdan and took refuge in the Isle of Balar, and even kept a foothold at the Mouths of Sirion, hidden in reeds and creeks. Turgon heard of this and sent messengers to ask Círdan to make ships to sail out into the West. Círdan built and sent seven ships, but no news of them came to Balar, save one ship that foundered in a storm near Nevrast.

Morgoth commanded the orcs to gather all the bodies, harness, and weapons of the fallen and pile them in a great mound in the midst of Anfauglith. It looked like a hill and was called Haudh-en-Nirnaeth (Hill of the Tears) by the elves.

- ~~Fëanor~~: **Maedhros**, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, Amras.
- ~~Fingolfin~~: ~~Fingon~~, **Turgon**, Aredhel.
- Finarfin: ~~Finrod~~, **Orodreth**, ~~Angrod~~, ~~Aegnor~~, Galadriel.


#### Túrin Turambar

Rían, wife of Huor, wedded him two months before he went to Nirnaeth Arnoediad. When no news came from him, she fled into the wild and gave birth to her son, Tuor, among the Grey-elves of Mithrim. Then, she departed to Haudh-en-Nirnaeth and died there. Morwen, wife of Húrin, stayed in Dor-lómin with his 8 years old son, Túrin. Then, the Easterlings came to Hithlum, despising the remnants of the people of Hador, oppressing them, taking their lands and goods, and enslaving their children. To protect his son, she sent Túrin with two servants to Doriath, and Túrin received him at Menegroth. Meanwhile, Morwen gave birth to Nienor, daughter of Húrin.

Túrin stayed in Menegroth for 9 years. Then, he joined the men-at-arms and went to battle on the marches of Doriath for 3 years. There, he became companion of Beleg, chief of the marshwardens. One day, a jealous king's counsellor waylaid him, but Túrin defeated and set him to run naked as a hunted beast through the woods. However, the counsellor fell into the chasm of a stream and died. Fearing to be held captive by Thingol, he escaped west of Sirion, beyond the Girdle of Melian, and joined a band of outlaws. However, Thingol pardoned him and sent Beleg to ask him to return, but Túrin decided to stay near Amon Rûdh. Beleg asked Thingol for permission to stay with Túrin to guard and guide him. Then, he went back to the north marches with his friends, where they drove back the orcs from Dimbar. In winter, when the war was stilled, he left them to join Túrin.

Meanwhile, Túrin then led the outlaws westward out of Sirion's vale, in search of a safer lair. They found 3 dwarves: Mîm and his sons Khîm and Ibun. They tried to escape, but Mîm was captured, Khîm was killed with an arrow, and Ibun escaped. As ransom, Mîm offered to lead them to his house, a cave upon Amon Rûdh. Túrin promised that, if he gets any wealth, he will pay a ransom of gold for his son. They stayed with Mîm and Ibun in their house. Mîm told him that he came from dwarves from the great dwarf-cities of the east, which were banished in ancient days, long before the return of Morgoth. Before the dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost came west over the mountains, the elves of Beleriand didn't know what they were, and hunted and slew them; but afterwards they let them alone and called them Noegyth Nibin (Petty-dwarves). The Petty-dwarves hated the Orcs, the Eldar, and the Exiles. They say that the Noldor stole their lands and homes. They discovered and the caves of Nargothrond and begun delving them long before Finrod came over the sea, and bdelved them long, and bored and deepened the caves beneath Amon Rûdh. But all these dwarves dwindled and died, save Mîm and his 2 sons.

In winter, Beleg arrived and joined Túrin and gave him the Helm of Hador, the Dragon-helm. Soon after, Morgoth forces came through Anach and took Dimbar and all the north marches of Doriath. They also came down the road from the defile of Sirion, and so through the land between Malduin and Sirion, and through the eaves of Brethil to the Crossings of Teiglin. Many who went leaderless and dispossessed joined Túrin and Beleg, the Two Captains. Their fame was heard in Menegroth, Nargothrond, Gondolin, and Angband. Morgoth realized that he was Húrin's son and sent spies to Amon Rûdh.

In the waning of the year Mîm and Ibun were captured by Orcs while gathering roots. Mîm promised to guide them to his home on Amon Rûdh but demanded that Túrin should not be slain, and the Orc-captain accepted. The Orcs attacked at night, slained Túrin's company, captured Túrin and took him to Angband. Beleg was injured but survived. Mîm, who hated Beleg, tried to kill him, but failed and escaped. Beleg followed the tracks of the Orcs through the Crossings of Teiglin, across Brithiach, Dimbar, the Pass of Anach, and the dreadfull woods of Taur-nu-Fuin. There, he found an elf sleeping in the forest: Gwindor, son of Guilin. He was captured by Morgoth during Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the fifth battle, and put to labour in the mines of the North because he was skilled in forging and mining metals and gems, but he finally escaped by secret tunnels. Gwindor joined Beleg and both continued until they reached the orcs near Anfauglith.

At night, they infiltrated the orcs' camp and rescued Túrin. However, in the darkness, when Beleg was cutting his ties with a sword, Túrin woke up, took the sword, and killed Beleg thinking that he was a foe. With great pain, they buried him and departed. They went to Ivrin's lake, continue along river Narog, and arrived to Nargothrond. King Orodreth welcomed Gwindor and Túrin. Both became counselors of the king. Túrin took the name of Black Sword. By the counsel of Túrin, to which Gwindor opposed, Nargothrond switched from secret tactics to open battle, managing to drive out the enemy from all the land between Falas and Sirion, but also revealing Nargothrond to Morgoth.

Due to this time of respite and hope, Morwen fled from Dor-lómin with Nienor her daughter to Thingol's halls. She found Túrin gone, and no news of him had come since he was captured at Amon Rûdh. They decided to stay in Doriath.

After 495 years since the rising of the Moon, in spring, bad news came to Nargothrond: a great mustering of enemies was under Ered Wethrin and in the Pass of Sirion, and Círdan said that Ulmo told him that Nargothrond was in danger. Soon afterwards, Handir, Lord of Brethil, was slain, for the Orcs invaded his land, and his men drove back into their woods. In autumn of that year, Morgoth released his forces and invaded Narog. Glaurung passed over Anfauglith and attacked the north vales of Sirion, including Eithel Ivrin, and then burned Talath Dirnen, the plain between Narog and Teiglin, in the realm of Nargothrond. The warriors of Nargothrond were driven back and pressed into the field of Tumhalad, where they were penned and defeated. King Orodreth and Gwindor were slain, but Túrin and some elves could escape. However, soon the enemy reached Nargothrond, which was attacked, destroyed, and ransacked; and captives were enslaved, including princess Finduilas. Túrin faced Gaurung in Nargothrond but couldn't defeat him and escaped. Glaurung then destroyed the bridge, gathered all the hoard and riches found, and lay upon them in the innermost hall.

Túrin headed north, passing Ivrin and the passes of Dor-lómin, and reaching the land of his childhood, where he discovered that Morwen had gone to Doriath. Some Hador's people joined him, and they became outlaws. He sought for Finduilas south Ered Wethrin and south Pass of Sirion without success. Some Men of Brethil he met told him that Finduilas and the other captives were executed at the Crossings of Teiglin when the Men of Brethil tried to rescue them. Túrin was taken to Ephel Brandir, an stockade upon Amon Obel, where Brandir son of Handir and ruler of the Men of Brethil welcomed him. Túrin took the name of Turambar.

Some survivors from Nargothrond arrived to Doriath and said that Black Sword was Túrin, and he was last seen there. Morwen and Nienor, together with Mablung and some march-wards, rode to Nargothrond in search of news on Túrin. They passed over Sirion and reached Amon Ethir, a hill near Narog. Then, Glaurung attacked them. Many were lost or slain. Glaurung laid a spell upon Nienor so that she lost her memories, even her own name. Then, Glaurung returned to Nargothrond. Mablung and some companions returned to Doriath. Morwen disappeared, and Nienor run away and got lost.

Nienor crossed the Crossings of Teiglin and entered Brethil, where Túrin and the woodmen found her. She couldn't remember anything before she was found. Túrin called her Níniel and she was taken to Ephel Brandir. Three years after the sack of Nargothrond, Túrin and Níniel got married, although Brandir also loved Níniel. In spring, she conceived. Glaurung left Nargothrond and near the summer he was near the west shores of Teiglin. Túrin decided to face Glaurung, so he headed to Nen Girith. Only two woodmen joined him: Dorlas and Hunthor. Dorlas shamed Brandir before his people for not joining.

Níniel was unwilling to wait and set forth after him, and a great company went with her. Brandir tried to stop them, but they didn't listen to him. Thus, Brandir renounced his lordship and went after Níniel.

Túrin reached river Teiglin at sundown and learned that Glaurung laid on the brink of the high shores of the Ravines of Teiglin, where the river ran in a deep and narrow gorge. Túrin decided to pass over the gorge at night: descend into the ravine, cross over the wild water, and climb up the cliff. Dorlas didn't dare to do that, and drew back in shame. Hunthor was hit by a great falling rock when climbing and died. Túrin reached the sleeping dragon and thrust his sword into the soft belly of the dragon, killing him. However, Glaurung's venomous blood burned Túrin's hand and he fainted.

When Níniel arrived, closely followed by Brandir, she saw Túrin laying beside the dragon. But with Glaurung's death, the spell over Níenor disappeared, and she remembered all her life (she was Níenor, daughter of Húrin of Dor-lómin, and sister of Túrin). She cried, blamed Túrin, and cast herself over the gorge into the wild water. This was seen by Brandir. Then, Brandir found Dorlas in the woods and killed him. He told the people that he had good news: the dragon, Níniel, and Túrin were dead; and that Níniel was Níenor, and Turambar was Túrin, and they were brothers. However, when Túrin woke up and learned what had happened, he accussed Brandir of leading Níniel to her death and publishing lies, and killed Brandir and fled into the woods.

While sitting in the Ravines of Teiglin, Mablung and a company of grey-elves that came from the Crossings of Teiglin met him. Mablung had heard tha Glaurung was going to Brethil, and that the Black Sword now dwelt there, so he came to warn and help him. Mablung told him that Morwen was lost, and that Nienor lost memory and escaped. Túring knew that doom had overtaken him, and that he killed Brandir unjustly. Desperate, he fled from them and, near the body of Glaurung, he killed himself with his sword.


#### The ruin of Doriath

Morgoth made Húrin suffer by showing him what happened with Morwen, Níenor, and Túrin. After 28 years of captivity, and a year after Túrin's death, Morgoth set Húrin free with the purpose of letting him further his hatred for Elves and Men before his death. Morgoth also sent spies to secretly follow him. He passed into Hitlum. Morgoth ordered the Easterlings to respect him, so they didn't lay hands on him. But his own people shunned him because he came from Angband as one in league and honour with Morgoth.

He crossed Ered Wethrin and Brithiach, and passed to Dimbar. He wanted to get to Gondolin, but the access was closed: the Dry river and the rock-wall were blocked by a great fall of stones. The eagles detected Húrin, and Thorondor brought word to Turgon, but Turgon considered that Húrin surrendered to the will of Morgoth and didn't let him enter. Turgon later regretted this, but was unable to find Húrin again. Húrin called Turgon, but was only heard by Morgoth's spies, who reported to Morgoth, who realized Turgon dwelt in that region.

Then he went back to Brithiach, passed the Crossings of Teiglin, and came to the place of Glaurung's death. He met Morwen there, who was waiting for him, but she died that night. He buried her.

He crossed over Teiglin and went along the ancient road to Nargothrond. Mîm had taken possession of Nargothrond. None else had come, from dread of the spirit and memory of Glaurung. Húrin, who knew who he was and how he betrayed Túrin, killed him, and stayed there a while. From there he took the Nauglamír, a necklace of Finrod made by the dwarves.

Then he went above the Falls of Sirion, where he was captured by elves and brought before Thingol, who welcomed him. But Húrin blamed Thingol for not keeping his wife and children, though soon regretted his words since it was not Thingol's fault. Húrin gave him the Nauglamír and then left Menegroth and disappeared. It's said that he cast himself into the western sea.

The dwarves still came into Beleriand from Ered Lindon, along the ancient road to Doriath, passing over Gelion and Aros, and dwelling in Menegroth. At that time, great craftsmen from Nogrod come to Doriath. Thingol asked them to modify the Nauglamír so it could hold the Silmaril. However, the dwarves were filled with lust and secretly desired the silmaril. When the work was done, instead of handing the jewel to Thingol, they killed him and fled eastwards through Region. But they were pursued, most of them were killed before crossing Aros, and the Nauglamír was recovered.

Thingol's death made Melian lose her power over the substance of Arda, and the Girdle of Melian that defended Doriath disappeared. Her power withdrawn from Neldoreth, Region, and river Esgalduin, and Doriath lay open to its enemies. Melian asked Mablung to take care of the silmaril and to send word to Beren and Lúthien in Ossiriand. Then she vanished out of Middle-earth and passed to the land of the Valar beyond the western sea.

Meanwhile, two of the dwarves managed to escape and reach Nogrod, where they told that Thingol didn't want to pay and slained the dwarves. They asked aid from Belegost, but it was denied. Nogrod sent a host across Gelion, Beleriand, and Aros, and entered into Doriath. The elves lost the battle in Menegroth, Mablung fell, and the silmaril was taken.

Beren and Lúthien were living in the island Tol Galen, in river Adurant. Their son Dior Eluchíl, living in Lanthir Lamath, had to wife Nimloth, kinswoman of Celeborn, prince of Doriath and husband of Galadriel. They had two sons, Eluréd and Elurín, and a daughter, Elwing. When they learned what happened in Doriath, Beren, Dior, and many green-elves of Ossiriand went north to river Ascar. When the dwarves of Nogrod, returning from Menegroth with diminished host, came again to Sarn Athrad (pass over Gelion near river Ascar), the elves ambushed them. Beren himself slew the Lord of Nogrod and recovered Nauglamír. Many dwarves were slain. Some escaped eastwards towards the mountains, but as they climbed the slopes beneath Mount Dolmed the Shepherds of the Trees drove them into the woods of Ered Lindon, and it's said that no one returned home. The treasure of Doriath was drowned in river Ascar, but Beren kept the Nauglamír and gave it to Lúthien. Dior Eluchíl, heir of Thingol, departed with Nimloth, Eluréd, Elurín and Elwing to Menegroth. The Sindar welcomed them, and they abode there.

When Beren and Lúthien died, the Nauglamír was sent to Dior. Soon, the oath of the sons of Fëanor woke up, and the seven gathered from wandering and sent to him to claim their own, but Dior didn't answer. Thus, they assaulted Doriath at unawares in winter. Dior killed Celegorm. But also died Dior, Nimloth, Curufin, and Caranthir. Eluréd and Elurín were left to starve in the forest. But Elwing and a remnant of the people fled before them with the silmaril and came to the mouths of river Sirion by the sea.


#### Tuor and the fall of Gondolin

Huor, the brother of Húrin, was slain in Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the fifth battle. In winter of that year his wife, Rían, bore a child named Tuor in the wilds of Mithrim. He was taken to foster by Annael of the Grey-elves, who yet lived in those hills. When Tuor was 16 year old the Elves were planning to leave the caves of Androth and go to the Havens of Sirion, but Orcs and Easterlings attacked them, and Tuor was taken captive and enslaved by Lorgan, chief of the Easterlings of Hithlum. After 3 years, he escaped an lived in the caves of Androth alone and did great hurt to the Easterlings. After 4 years, he went westwards across Dor-lómin, and found the Gate of the Noldor (Annon-in-Gelydh), built by the people of Turgon when they dwelt in Nevrast. Thence a tunnel led beneath the mountains, and issued into the Rainbow Cleft (Cirith Ninniach), through which a turbulent water ran towards the sea. He came into Nevrast and stayed there.

After some months, he discovered the deserted halls of Vinyamar beneath Mount Taras. When Huor was at the shore, Ulmo arose from the waters and bade him to seek out Gondolin. Huor found an elf standing in front of Vinyamar: Voronnwë, son of Aranwë, of Gondolin. He sailed in the last ship that Turgon sent into the West, which foundered in the great storm when returning. Ulmo saved him and casted him near Vinyamar. He leaded Tuor to Gondolin. They went eastward through Ered Wethrin. At the Pools of Ivrin, already defiled by Glaurung, they saw a tall man with a black sword going northward in haste. They didn't know what happened in the south. Turgon welcomed Tuor since he was sent there by Ulmo. Ulmo spoke through Tuor and told Turgon that the Curse of Mandos was nearly fulfilled, that all the works of the Noldor should perish, and bade him abandon the city and go down Sirion to the sea. Turgon rejected the bidding of Ulmo, but blocked up the entrance to Tumladen. Thorondor brought tidings of the fall of Nargothrond and the ruin of Doriath.

Over time, Tuor and Idril Celebrindal, the king's daughter, fell in love. But Maeglin, son of Turgon's sister, desired her. After 7 years living in Gondolin, Turgon gave Tuor the hand of Idril, and the next year they had a son: Eärendil Halfelven (503 years since the coming of the Noldor to Middle-earth).

Gondolin had been revealed to Morgoth by the cries of Húrin, but no creature from Angband could pass because of the vigilance of the eagles. Idril, as a precaution, secretly ordered to build a tunnel going north from the city to the plain far beyond the walls. Maeglin and some of his folks used to go to the mountains to mine, but he often went secretly beyond the leaguer of the hills, which caused him to be captured by Orcs and taken to Angband. Under torture, Maeglin revealed how to access Gondolin. Morgoth promised him the lordship of Gondolin as his vassal and possesion of Idril, and sent him back to Gondolin to avoid suspicions and to aid the assault from within.

When Eärendil was 7 years old, Morgoth attacked Gondolin with Orcs, Balrogs, wolves, and dragons at night from the north, where the height was greatest and the watch least vigilant. The defense was desperate. Tuor sought to rescue Idril from the sack, but Maeglin had laid hands on her and Eärendil, so Tuor fought and killed him. Tuor and Idril took as many people of Gondolin as could gather down Idril's secret way and escaped to the north mountains aided by the smoke and steam that fell upon the vale. But Morgoth put watches in the encircling hills, and they were ambushed in the mountains by Orcs and a Balrog, in a pass among two cliffs. Glorfindel fought the Balrog and both fell into an abyss. But the eagles, with Thorondor, came and slained the Orcs.

They passed over the mountains and came down into the Vale of Sirion, and fleeing southward they came at length to Nan-tathren, where they rested a while. Then they continued to the mouths of Sirion where they joined to the company of Elwing, Dior's daughter, that had fled a little while before. After the death of Turgon, Gil-galad son of Fingon was named High King of the Noldor in Middle-earth. By Sirion and the sea there grew up an Elven-folk made of people from Doriath and Gondolin, and even mariners of Círdan from Balar. They dwelt in the coasts of Arvernien.

Morgoth thought his triumph was fulfilled, recking little of the sons of Fëanor, and their oath, which never harmed him and turned always to his mightiest aid. He gave no sign of knowing about those dwelling by the waters of Sirion.

It's said that Ulmo came to Valinor and asked the Valar to forgive the elves and rescue them, but Manwë moved not. When Tuor felt old, he built a ship and sailed into the sunset and the West, disappearing forever. It's said that he joined the Noldor.


#### The voyage or Eärendil and the war of Wrath

Eärendil became lord of the people dwelling in Sirion's mouths. He took Elwing as wife, and they had two sons: Elrond and Elros. Eärenil became friend of Círdan the Shipwright, who dwelt in the Isle of Balar with those people who escaped from the sack of the Havens of Brithombar and Eglarest. Eärendil wanted to sail in search of his parents, Tuor and Idril, and perhaps find the Valar and get help. With the aid of Círdan he built a good ship, Vingilot, that he used for exploring many seas, island, and untrodden lands. But Elwing stayed in Sirion's mouths in sorrow.

When Maedhros learned that Elwing was alive in Sirion's mouths and in possession of the silmaril, he gathered his brothers from their wandering and sent a message demanding it. She rejected the request because Beren won it, Lúthien worn it, Dior was slained for it, and Eärendil their lord was on the sea. Thus, the sons of Fëanor came down suddenly upon them and destroy them. In the battle, some of their own people stood aside, and some few rebeled, but Maedhros and Maglor won the day, though Amrod and Amras were slain. The ships of Círdan and Gil-galad came hasting to their aid, but it was too late. The survivors joined to Gil-galad and went with him to Balar. Elros and Elrond were taken captive. Elwing with the silmaril casted herself into the sea, but Ulmo saved her and sent her flying to Eärendil.

Meanwhile, Eärendil was on the sea with 3 mariners (Falathar, Erellont, Aerandir). He couldn't find his parents, nor reach Valinor, which was prevented by the shadows, enchantments, and repelling winds. He was returning home when Elwing fell from the air upon the ship. Eärendil saw now no hope left in Middle-earth, and sought back once more to Valinor. It's said that thanks to the power of the silmaril they could reach the Enchanted Isles and escape their enchantment, reach the Shadowy Seas and pass their shadows, pass Tol Eressëa (Lonely Isle), and cast anchor in the Bay of Eldamar.

Only Eärendil and Elwing set foot, in case the Valar release their wrath for passing the leaguer of Aman, and said goodbye to the mariners. Eärendil left Elwing and entered alone into the Calacirya, climbed the hill of Túna, and entered the city of Tirion, which was empty. It was a time of festival and the Elvenfolk were gone to Valimar or the halls of Manwë upon Taniquetil. But some watchers upon Tirion's walls saw him from afar and went in haste to Valimar. Eönwë, herald of Manwë, came from Valimar and welcomed him. Eärendil went to Valinor and to the halls of Valimar. The Valar took counsel, and Eärendil asked pardon fo rthe Noldor, pity for their sorrows, mercy upon Men and Elves, and succour in their need. And his prayer was granted.

Manwë let Eärendil, Elwing, and their children choose to which kindred they want to belong, and both chose elven one. They were not allowed to walk again in the Outer Lands.

The Valar gave the 3 mariners a boat and drove them away into the East with a great wind. The Vingilot was taken through Valinor to the uttermost rim of the world, beyond the Door of Night, and was lifted up even into the oceans of heaven. Eärendil with the silmaril journeyed in that ship beyond the confines of the world, even into the starless voids. And the silmaril was seen from Middle-earth like a star. And a white tower northward upon the borders of the Sundering Seas was built for Elwing.

The host of the Valar were leaded by Eönwë, and included the Vanyar (the people of Ingwë) and the Noldor that never departed (leaded by Finarfin son of Finwë). Few Teleri went to war, for they remembered the slaying of Alqualondë and the rape of their ships, but sent mariners enough to sail the ships that bore the host over the sea, yet stayed aboard their vessels and didn't set foot. The few men remaining from the 3 houses of Men that were friends of the elves, joined the Valar in their fight; but a great part of the sons of Men (people of Uldor and other newcomers from the east) joined Morgoth. Most Orcs and Balrogs were destroyed, and survivors hid themselves. In a last desperate assault, Morgoth released the winged dragons, that had not been seen before, and the host of the Valar was driven back. But Eärendil came with the Vingilot, together with the eagles leaded by Thorondor, and destroyed all the dragons.

Thangorodrim and the pits were broken. Morgoth was captured in his deepest mine and put in chains. Eönwë took and guarded the two silmarils. A multitude of slaves were liberated. The Great Battle reshaped the land, mountains, valleys, rivers, and coastline.

Maedhros and Maglor asked Eönwë to give them the silmarils, but he answered that they lost the right to possess them, because of their many merciless deeds, being blinded by their oath. Then they disguised themselves and stole them at night from the camp of Eönwë, but all the camp raised against them, and they prepared to fight to the death, but Eönwë let them go with the silmarils. But the silmarils burned in their hands with unbearable pain. Maedros, in anguish and despair, cast himself into a chasm filled with fire, and his silmaril fell to the depths of the Earth. Maglor cast his silmaril into the Sea.

The Vanyar returned to Valinor. Eönwë summoned the Elves of Beleriand to depart from Middle-earth. Many ships were built, and the Eldar set sail into the West, and dwelt upon Tol Eressëa. The Valar an the Teleri forgave them, and the curse was laid to rest. But some Eldalië didn't want to leave Middle-earth, such as Círdan, Celeborn, Galadriel, Gil-galad, Elrond (who chose to be an Eldar), and Elros (who chose to be a Man).

From Elrond and Elros, sons of Eärendil and Elwing, came among Men the blood of the elves and a strain of the divine spirits that were before Arda. Remember:

- Thingol + Melian > Lúthien > Dior > Elwing
- Turgon > Idril > Eärendil

Morgoth was thrust through the Door of Night beyond the Walls of the World, into the Timeless Void. A guard was set on those walls forever, and Eärendil keeps watch upon the walls of the sky.


### Akallabêth: The downfall of Númenor

Men came into the world when Morgoth had great control of the land, so they fell under his evil influence. But some of them turned from evil and left the lands of their kindred, and went westward, for they heard that there was a light in the West that Morgoth could not dim. They were pursued by Morgoth's servants, yet they entered Beleriand during the War of the Jewels. They were called Edain, and became friends and allies of the Eldar. One of them, Eärendil, when the victory of Morgoth was almost complete, built his ship Vingilot and searched for Valinor. Once there, he asked for help, and Valinor sent his host. In the Great Battle, the Edain alone of the kindreds of Men fought for the Valar, whereas many others fought for Morgoth.

After the victory of the Valar, the evil Men that survived fled back into the east. There were already mens wandering in the east, but the evil Men cast over them a shadow of fear, and they took them for kings. And Men dwelt in darkness and were troubled by many evil things devised by Morgoth: orcs, dragons, and demons. Thought Manwë shut Morgoth beyond the World in the Void that is without, the seeds the he planted still grew and sprouted, for his will remained and guided his servants against the Valar and their followers.

The Eldar that returned to the West dwelt in the isle of Tol Eressëa, where the city of Avallónë was the easternmost of Aman. To the Fathers of Men of the 3 faithful houses, Eönwë gave wisdom, power, health, and a life longer than any other mortal race. An isle, Númenor, was made for the Edain to dwell between Middle-earth and Valinor. It was raised by Ossë, established by Aulë, and enriched by Yavanna. In its center was a tall and steep mountain, Meneltarma. It contained the city of Andúnië (chief city in the west coast) and Armenelos (upon a hill at the feet of Meneltarma). These people were called Dúnedain, or Númenóreans, and the Valar appointed Elros as their king.

Brothers Elros and Elrond descended from the Three houses of the Edain, but in part also from the Eldar (Idril) and the Maiar (Lúthien). The Valar let the sons of Eärendil choose their the own destiny (elven or man). Elrond chose to be an elve, Elros chose to be a man. But to Elros line was given an even longer lifespan than regular númenóreans (he lived 500 years, and reigned for 410).

The Valar forbade númenóreans to sail so far westward that the coasts of Númenor could no longer be seen. At times, elves from Tol Eressëa visited Númenor. Númenóreans always sailed eastward, and explored the North (darkness), Middle-earth, south (heat), Nether Lands (land beyond south not lit by the sun or moon), and the inner seas. They had contact with Men from Middle-earth and taught them many things that improved their life.

Saurion  arose again in Middle-earth and grew. In the days of Tar-Minastir (11th king), Sauron had fortified Mordor and built the Tower of Barad-dûr, and since then pursued the domination of Middle-earth. Tar-Minastir helped Gil-galad when the One Ring was forged and there was war between Elves and Sauron in Eriador. Sauron hated the númenóreans, but didn't dare to challenge them yet, and withdrew from the coasts.

Tar-Ciryatan (12th king) and his son Tar-Atanamir (13th king, more than 2000 years after Númenor's creation) laid Middle-earth's men under tribute, taking rather than giving. And the king and most people, wanting to escape death, began to talk against the ban which forbade to sail into the West. During the reign of King Tar-Ancalimon (14th king), son of Tar-Atanamir, the Númenóreans became divided:

- King's men (greater party): They wanted to go to Aman. Unfriendly to Eldar and Valar. They made the first númenórean great settlements in Middle-earth. They turned more proud, materialistic, and ambitious, and desired wealth and dominion in Middle-earth. They often sailed to the south, and made lordships and strongholds.
- Elendili (lesser party): Friends of elves. They often go to the north, and the land of Gil-galad, and helped them against Sauron, and their haven was Pelargir, above the mouths of Anduin.

It's said that among those whom Sauron ensnared with the Nine Rings, three were great númenórean lords. And when these nine servants became too powerful, he attacked the númenórean strong places upon the shores of the sea.

The Lords of Andúnië came from the line of Elros, descending from Silmarien, daughter of Tar-Elendil (4th king). They were loyal to the kings, and were always councillor of the king, but also love the Eldar and reverence the Valar, though they didn't declare it openly as the shadow grew.

Adûnakhôr (20th king) forsake the elven-tongues and their use in his hearing. His son Ar-Gimilzôr (23th king) forbade utterly the use of elven-tongues, punished to welcome ships from Eressëa, and commanded to relocate those Elendili from west Númenor to east Númenor. Many Elendili moved to the kingdom of Gil-galad, in north Middle-earth. The Valar got angry with the kings, and gave them no more counsel and protection. Ar-Gimilzôr had 2 sons: Inziladûn (eldest and faithful) and Gimilkhâd (against elves and Valar). Inziladûn (24th king), Tar-Palantir in elven-tongue, gave peace to the faithful, but his brother opposed him with the King's Men. No ship came ever again from the West to Númenor. Over time, Gimilkhâd died, and then Tar-Palantir. The heir was Míriel, daughter of Tar-Palantir. But Pharazôn, son of Gimilkhâd, leaded the King's Men and took Míriel as his wife against his will and the laws.

At that time, Sauron was attacking western Middle-earth trying to drive númenóreans into the sea, and even destroy Númenor, if possible. Pharazôn gathered a mighty army and sailed into the East. The fleet came to Umbar, a mighty númenórean haven, and journeyed for 7 days. Sauron, unable to face such a strong opponent, didn't offer batlle and pledged allegiance to him. Sauron was taken hostage to Númenor. After 3 years, Sauron, who was wise and cunning, had become closest to the secret king's councillors, and gained the favour of the king. Thus, all the councillors began to fawn upon him, save Amandil lord of Andúnië. Sauron made men think many things: that there are many seas in east and west, and the Ancient Darkness is even beyond; that Eru is an invention from the Valar to enchain men in servitude, and that Morgoth is the real master and he can make men stronger than the Valar. Then the king turned back to the worship of Morgoth.

A remnant of the Faithful yet dwelt in Númenor, mainly in Rómenna, leaded by Amandil, councillor of the King, and his son Elendil, whose sons were Isildur and Anárion. Amandil and Elendil were of the line of Elros, but not of the ruling house in Armenelos. However, Amandil was dismissed, and withdrew to Rómenna. A temple to Morgoth was built in Armenelos where sacrifices were done, mostly Faithfuls often accused of false charges.

Sauron and those bound to him went about the land setting man against man. But Sauron made Númenor stronger and richer. He helped to multiply their possessions, devise engines, and build greater ships. And they hunted men in Middle-earth, took their goods, enslaved them, and many were sacrificed in their altars. And men feared them. Ar-Pharazôn became the mightiest tyrant since the reign of Morgoth, though Sauron ruled all from behind the throne.

When Ar-Pharazôn felt his death was near, Sauron convinced him to make war against the Valar. Sauron said that no one can die in Aman, and that the Valar lied at him because of their avarice. When Amandil learned that the king was preparing an army, he sailed west with 3 servants to ask for help. Nothing was heard of them again. Elendil and the Faithfull embarked in his ships. 

Ar-Pharazôn gathered a huge fleet, embarked his army, and sailed to the west. The fleet encompassed Avallónë and all the isle of Eressëa. And Ar-Pharazôn came to Aman and the coasts of Valinor, and a host encamped about Túna, where all the Eldar had fled. Manwë upon Taniquetil called upon Ilúvatar, and Ilúvatar changed the fashion of the world. A great chasm opened in the sea between Númenor and Aman, and the waters flowed into it, and the númenórean fleets was swallowed up. Ar-Pharazôn and his warriors were buried under falling hills. Aman and Eressëa were taken away into the realm of hidden things. Earthquakes utterly destroyed Númenor. The sea flooded western Middle-earth, modifying the land and the coasts<<<. The world was made round. After 93 days since the destruction of the fleet, Númenor went down into the sea. By the grace of the Valar, Elendil and his sons survived all this, and a strong wind sent their 9 ships across the sea to Middle-earth shores. Over time, Elendil and his sons founded kingdoms in Middle-earth.

Sauron sank with Númenor, but he was not of mortal flesh. He lost his previous shape, but his spirit arose out of the dep and flew back to Mordor as a shadowy black wind. There he took up again his great Ring in Barad-dûr and dwelt until he created a new guise.

The Eldar were permitted to depart and come to Eressëa and Aman, if they would.


### The Rings of Power & the Third Age

In the beginning of Arda, Melkor seduced the Maiar Sauron to his allegiance, and he became the greatest and most trusted of his servants. He could assume many forms. In the Great Battle, Belerian was broken and laid waste, and northward and westward many lands sank beneath the sea. After Morgoth's defeat, Sauron did obeisance to Eönwe, herald of Manwë, and abjured all his evil deeds. Eönwe commanded Sauron to return to Aman to receive the judgment of Manwë, but he instead hid himself in Middle-earth.

The walls of Ered Luin were broken, and a great gap was made in them towards the south, and a gulf of the sea flowed in. Into that gulf the River Lhûn fell by a new course, and it was called therefore the Gulf of Lhûn. Since old times, that country was called Lindon by the Noldor, and many Eldar still dwelt there. Gil-galad son of Fingon was their king, and with him was Elron son of Eärendil and brother of Elros, first king of Númenor. The elves built Mithlond (Grey havens), where they held many ships. The Valar allowed only the elves to navigate beyond the world to Eressëa and Valinor, and they used these ships to do so.

Other Eldar crossed Ered Luin and passed to the inner lands, where . Many of them were Teleri, survivors of Doriath and Ossiriand, and established realms among the Silvan Elves in woods and mountains far from the sea. Only in Eregion the elves of Noldorin race established a lasting realm beyond Ered Luin. Eregion was close to Khazad-dûm (later Moria), where dwarves lived. Friendship arose between Eregion's smithers became  and Khazad-dûm. The jewel's craftmanship in Eregion surpassed all that have ever wrought, save only Fëanor; and the greatest in skill among them was Celebrimbor, son of Curufin.

Many Avari had been living in Middle-earth far from the sea. In the south and the further east Men multiplied, but Sauron turned most of them to evil. He found Men the easiest to sway of all the peoples. Sauron disguised himself with fairness and wisdom, and took the name of Annatar (the Lord of Gifts). He sought to persuaded elves to his service, but only to Lindon he did not come, for Gil-galad and Elrond doubted him, though they didn't know who he really was. Elsewhere, elves received him gladly, and at first they had much profit from his friendship. 

Sauron was welcomed in Eregion and they learned of him many things, and they even made Rings of Power, guided by Sauron. Sauron's desire was to set a bond upon the elves and keep them under surveillance. The elves made many rings, but secretly Sauron made One Ring to rule all the others, forged in Orodruin. Their power was bound up with it, to be subject wholly to it and to last only so long as it too should last. Much of the strength and will of Sauron passed into this ring, for the power of the Elven-rings was great, and the one to govern them must have surpassing potency. While he wore the One Ring he could perceive all the things that were done by means of the lesser rings, and he could see and govern the very thoughts of those that wore them.

But as soon as Sauron set the One Ring upon his finger, the elves were aware of him, knew him, and perceived that he would be the master of them, so they took off their rings. Not being able to deceive the elves, he came against them in open war, demanding all the rings to be delivered to him. But the elves fled from him, and three of their rings they saved and hid (Narya, Nenya, Vilya). These three rings were forged by Celebrimbor alone, and they allowed to ward off the decays of time and postpone the weariness of the world. They were not openly used while Sauron kept the One Ring. 

Since then, war never ceased between Sauron and the Elves. Eregion was destroyed, and Celebrimbor slain, and the doors of Moria were shut. Elrond founded Rivendel, a stronghold and refuge. Sauron recovered all the remaining Rings of Power and gave them to other peoples to dominate all those that desired great power: Seven rings for the Dwarves, and Nine to Men.

The Dwarves proved hard to tame. They used the rings only for the getting of wealth. It's said that the foundation of each of the Seven Hoards  of the Dwarf-kings of old was a golden ring. But those hoards were plundered long ago and the Dragons devoured them. Of the Seven Rings, some were consumed by fire and some recovered by Sauron.

Men proved easier to ensnare. Those who used the rings became mighty, kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old. They obtained glory and wealth. They provided unending life, invisibility, and visions. But in the end they were enslaved by the One Ring, and became invisible forever, save to him that wore the One Ring. They became the Nazgûl, Sauron's most terrible servants.

Sauron decided to dominate Middle-earth, destroy the elves, and compass the downfall of Númenor. He gathered all the evil things of the days of Morgoth that remained, and the Orcs were under his command and they multiplied like flies. Many elves fled to Lindon and thence to Eressëa and Valinor, while others were destroyed by Sauron and his servants. But in Lindon, Gil-galad maintained his power with the help of númenóreans. All men in the east and south fell under Sauron's dominion. But then he was challenged by the army of Númenor, which he could not withstand, taken hostage by king Pharazôn, and brought to Númenor. Over the years he corrupted the hearts of most of that people, and set them at war with the Valar, and so compassed their ruin, as he desired. But that ruin was more terrible than he had forseen. The island of Númenor sank into the sea, and Sauron went down with it. But his spirit arose and flew to Middle-earth. In his absence, Gil-galad's power had grown, and had spread to the north and west, passing beyond the Misty Mountains and river Anduin even to the borders of Greenwood, and was drawing close to Sauron's strong places. Sauron withdrew to Mordor.

The númenórean survivors fled eastwards, leaded by Elendil and his sons, Isildur and Anárion, kinsmen of the king and descendants of Elros. They didn't listen to Sauron, nor went to war with the Valar. Elendil was cast into Lindon and was befriended by Gil-galad. Thence he passed up the River Lhûn, and beyond Ered Luin he established the realm of Arnor. His people dwelt in many places in Eriador about the courses of the Lhûn and the Baranduin. His chief city was at Annúminas, beside Lake Nenuial. They also dwelt at Fornost upon the North Downs, in Cardolan, and in the hills of Rhudaur.

Isildur and Anárion were borne southwards where they brought their ships up river Anduin and established the realm of Gondor, which was ruled by both brothers jointly. Númenor had established a haven and strong places about the mouths of Anduin. The brothers founded Osgiliath, the chief city of Gondor, through the midst of which Anduin flowed. Minas Ithil was a strong place eastward upon a shoulder of the mountains of Mordor, defence against Mordor, and house of Isildur. Minas Anor was a strong place westward at the feet of Mount Mindolluin, defence against the wild men of the valleys, and house of Anárion. They built other works at the Argonath (large statues of Isildur and Anárion), at Aglarond (large cave system under the White Mountains), at Erech (Stone of Erech), and Isengard (Pinnacle of Orthanc).

The Seven Stones (Palantíri) were an old gift from the Valar to Amandil, father of Elendil. Elendil and his sons brought from Númenor. They allowed to perceive things far off in place or in time. They were put in different places: Emyn Beraid, Amon Sûl, Annúminas city, Minas Ithil, Minar Anor, Orthanc, and Osgiliath. The master stone abides in Avallónë.

In a few years it became manifest that Sauron had returned. Sauron had returned in secret to Mordor. His fortress was Barad-dûr, and not far was the mountain Orodruin, where he forged the One Ring. He stayed there until he acquired a new and terrible shape. Sauron prepared war against Eldar and Men. He gathered his servants from east and south. Sauron had already bent to his will many men in Middle-earth, including many númenóreans, and they served him gladly. Because of the power of Gil-galad, most of these renegades lived in the southlands. The Haradrim were people living south of Mordor beyond Anduin's mouths.  

Sauron attacked and took Minas Ithil. Isildur escaped by ship down the river and sailed from Anduin's mouths seeking Elendil. Meanwhile, Anárion held Osgiliath and drove him back, but he couldn't hold much longer. Elendil and Gil-galad, perceiving that Sauron would grow too strong, decided to join forces in a league called the Last Alliance. A great host of Elves and Men marched east, halted for a while at Rivendel, crossed the Misty Mountains, marched down River Anduin, and came upon the host of Sauron on Dagorlad (Battle Plain). Both armies had people from all races, save the Elves alone since all them followed Gil-galad. Durin of Moria and his dwarves fought against Sauron. Gil-galad and Elendil had the victory. They passed into Mordor, encompassed Barad-dûr, and laid siege to it for seven years, but it suffered heavy losses. Anárion was slain in the valley of Gorgoroth, and many others. At last, Sauron himself came forth and fought with Gil-galad and Elendil, and both were slain, but Sauron was thrown down and Isildur cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Sauron left his body and his spirit fled far away and hid, and didn't take visible shape for many years.

Thus began the Third Age of the world. Sauron's servants were routed and dispersed, but not wholly destroyed. Barad-dûr was levelled to the ground. None dared dwell in Mordor because of the memory of Sauron, the Orodruin, and the valley of Gorgoroth filled with ash. Elrond and Círdan counselled Isildur to destroy the One Ring by casting it to the fire of Orodruin, so that Sauron's power should be forever diminished, and he should remain only a shadow of malice. But Isildur refused and took it as a heirloom of his house. He committed Gondor to Meneldil, Anárion's son, and marched north to take up Arnor by the same way that his father had come. But a host of Orcs that laid in wait in the Misty mountains descended and attacked his camp between Anduin and Greenwood, near the Gladden Fields. Most of his people died, including his three elder sons. Isildur escaped using the ring, which makes its user invisible, but it left his finger while swimming across the Anduin. The Orcs, who were following his trail, shot him with many arrows, killing him, and the ring got lost in the river.

Isildur had left his wife and his youngest son, Valandil, in Rivendel when he went to war. Valandil inherited Arnor and dwelt in Annúminas, but many had fallen and his folk were diminished. After the days of Eärendur, the 7th king that followed Valandil, the Dúnedain of the north became divided into petty realms and lordships, and their foes devoured them one by one, and they were forgotten. They became wanderers in the wild, and only in Rivendel their ancestry was not forgotten. The heirs of Isildur harboured in Rivendel because of their kinship with Elrond; thus, the line of the heirs of Isildur, from father to son, remained unbroken.

Gondor prospered, until it recalled the wealth and majesty of Númenor. But at last, the line of Meneldil failed. The númenóreans blood had become much mingled with that of other men, diminishing their power, wisdom, and lifespan. In the days of Telemnar, the 23th of Meneldil's line, a plague from the east killed the king and his children and many people from Gondor. The forts on the borders of Mordor were deserted, including Minas Ithil and Osgiliath. It's said that the Nazgûl, who had long remained hidden, returned to Mordor to prepare the ways of Sauron, who was growing again.

In the days of Eärnil they took Minas Ithil at night, which was thereafter called Minas Morgul (Tower of Sorcery). Then Osgiliath became a city of ruins and ghosts. But Minas Anor endured, and was renamed as Minas Tirith (Tower of Guard). The lands west of Anduin were protected. Eärnur, son of Eärnil, and last king of Gondor, rode alone to Minas Morgul to meet the challenge of the Morgul-lord, and he met him in single combar, but he was betrayed by the Nazgûl and taken alive into the city. Eärnur left no heir. Then, the Stewards of the house of Mardil the Faithful rules Gondor. The Rohirrim, Horsemen of the North, came and dwelt in the green land of Rohan, part of the kingdom of Gondor, and helped Minas Tirith in their wars. Northward, beyond the Fall of Rauros and the Gates of Argonath, there were other defenses, ancient powers little know by men.

In Eriador, Rivendel was the chief dwelling of the High Elves. At the Grey Havens, ruled by Círdan, abode also a remnant of Gil-galad's people. After the fall of Sauron, the Elves used their three rings to preserve their bliss, environment, and beauty undiminished. Elrond, in Rivendel, had one; Galadriel, in Lórien, had another; and the third none knew to whom it had been committed, save Elrond, Galadriel, and Círdan. It was said that, either if the One Ring is found by Sauron, or if it's destroyed by his enemies, the power of the three rings will fail and all things maintained by them will fade, and so the elves should pass into the twilight and the dominion of men begin.

The realm of King Thranduil was in Greenwood. After a third of that age passed, darkness, fear, and evil creatures entered slowly in the forest from the south. Then, the forest name was changed to Mirkwood. But Thranduil held the evil at bay in the north. It was Sauron, who came from the wastes of the east and moved to the south of the forest, to the hill of Dol Guldur. He slowly grew and took shape again. 

As the first shadows were felt in Mirkwood, there appeared in the west of Middle-earth the Istari, called Wizards by men. They came over the sea from the west, and looked like men, old but vigorous, aged slowly, and had many powers. They journeyed among Elves and men, and held converse with animals. The chiefs among them were Gandalf and Saruman. The wizards were:

- Radagast: Friend of all animals.
- Saruman: Went most among Men. He journeyed into the East, and when he returned he dwelt at Orthanc.
- Gandalf: Close to Elrond and the Elves. He wandered far in the north and west, and never made a lasting abode.
- Others: The others went into east Middle-earth.

Gandalf suspected that the shadow in Mirkwood could be Sauron, so he went to Dol Guldur, and Sauron fled from him. Many suppossed that it was a Nazgûl. There was peace for a long time, but at length the shadow returned and its power increased. A council (the White Council) was made by Elrond, Galadriel, Círdan, and other lords of the Eldar, together with Saruman and Gandalf. As the Shadow grew ever greater, Gandalf went again to Dol Guldur and discovered that it was Sauron, and escaped. He had taken shape again, and was gathering again all the rings and looking for the One Ring. The White Council was summoned and Gandalf urged them to take action quickly, but Saruman counselled to wait and watch, because he thought that the One Ring was taken by the Anduin to the sea, and will never be found. Thus, nothing was done.

No one perceived that Saruman had turned to dark thoughts, for he desired to find the One Ring and use it to rule the world. He expected the One Ring to seek for its master as he became manifest. But driving Sauron out would make the ring lie hid. He set a watch upon the Gladden Fields, but soon discovered that Sauron was looking for the ring in that region. He withdrew to Isengard, fortified it, and gathered many spies, including birds. 

The White Council was summoned, and Gandalf asked to strike Sauron. The might of elves and elf-friend was less than of old, and soon Sauron could become stronger than them even without the One Ring, for he ruled the Nine and recovered three of the Seven. Saruman assented, desiring to thrust Sauron from Dol Guldur to prevent him from searching near the river. Thus, Dol Guldur was attacked and Sauron was driven from there. But it was too late. He returned to Mordor and raised Barad-dûr again. Orcs were mustering, and the wild peoples from the far east and south were arming. It was then when the One Ring was found.

The One Ring was found in the river long ago by one of the small fisher-folk that dwelt by the Anduin, and he brought it to a cave deep under the mountains. There it dwelt, until the year of the assault upon Dol Guldur it was found by a traveller pursued by orcs, and he took it to west Eriador, to the land of the Hobbits. Gandalf was the first to learn of the ring. It could not be destroyed by the craft of the elves. With the help of the Dúnedain of the North, Gandalf set watch upon that land and bided his time. But Sauron had spies, and soon heard rumour of the One Ring, and sent forth the Nazgûl to take it.

Then the war started (War of the Ring). The heir of Isildur (39th in the line of Isildur), Aragorn son of Arathorn, arose in the North, and went to war. Battle was in Rohan. Saruman was thrown down, and Isengard broken. A great battle was fought before Minas Tirith, and the Lord of Morgul passed into darkness, and Aragorn led the host to the Black Gates of Mordor. In this last battle was Gandalf, Elrond's sons, Rohan's king, lords of Gondor, Isildur's heir, and the Dúnedain of the North. But Sauron was too strong, and they looked upon death and defeat. But it was then when the Hobbits saved the day.

Gandalf had asked the Hobbit Frodo to take the One Ring and, alone with his servant, infiltrate Mordor and cast the ring into the fire of mountain Orodruin. And the ring was unmade and its evil consumed. Sauron was utterly vanquished and passed away like a shadow of malice, and Barad-dûr crumbled in ruin. Peace came again. Aragorn was crowned king of Gondor and Arnor, and the might and glory of the Dúnedain raised again. Before Gandalf departed to the West, it was revealed that he had long guarded the third ring of the elves, which Círdan gave to him, and finally Gandalf returned it to Círdan. After the destruction of the One Ring, the Three rings lost their power, and the world grew old and grey for the elves. The last of the Noldor set sail from the Grey Havens and left Middle-earth forever. This way the Third Age ended, and the dominion of Men begun.


## The Hobbit

Thror was the king of Durin's folk, ruler of Erebor, the Lonely Mountain. The wealth of the kingdom attracted dragon Smaug, who attacked and destroyed the kingdom, entered the mountain, blocked the entrance, and took possession of its treasures. Most survivors migrated to the Iron Hills, but some followed the king Thror, his son Thráin II, and grandson Thorin Oakenshield westward into a long homeless wandering before settling in the hills of Dunland. Before his death, Thror gave Thráin the last of the dwarven Ring of Power, a key to a mountain's side door, and a map. Eventually, Tráin and his people relocated to northern Blue Mountains. With the purpose of reclaiming his kingdom of Erebor, Thráin and some followers, including Balin and Dwalin, journeyed into Wilderland, but Thráin was captured in the eaves of Mirkwood by servants of Sauron and locked in Dol Guldur. Sauron took his ring and left him there to die. When Gandalf went to Dol Guldur he found Thráin. He gave Gandalf the key and the map, and died. Later, Gandalf met Thorin in the village of Bree and promised to help him in his quest to reclaim Erebor.

Gandalf tricked the hobbit Bilbo Baggins into hosting a party for Thorin and his band of twelve dwarves (Dwalin, Balin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur), who plan to reclaim Erebor, and its vast treasure from the dragon. Gandalf unveils Thror's map showing a secret door into the Mountain and proposes Bilbo as the expedition's "burglar". The dwarves ridicule the idea, but Bilbo, indignant, sets off with them.

The group travels into the wild. Gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to Rivendell, where Elrond reveals more secrets from the map. When they attempt to cross the Misty Mountains, they are caught by goblins and driven deep underground. Although Gandalf kills the goblin king and rescues them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblins. Lost in the goblin tunnels, he finds a mysterious ring and then encounters Gollum, the owner of the ring. Gollum tries to recover the ring, but Bilbo escapes with the help of the ring, which confers invisibility when worn, and rejoins the dwarves, improving his reputation with them. The goblins and Wargs give chase, but the company are saved by eagles. They rest in the house of the skin-changer Beorn.

The company enters Mirkwood without Gandalf, who has other responsibilities. There, Bilbo saves the dwarves from giant spiders, and then from the dungeons of the Wood-elves. Nearing Erebor, the travellers are welcomed by the human inhabitants of Lake-town, who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug's demise. The expedition reaches the mountain and finds the secret door. The dwarves send a reluctant Bilbo inside to scout the dragon's lair. He steals a great cup and, while conversing with Smaug, spots a gap in the ancient dragon's armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town has aided the intruders, flies off to destroy the town. A thrush overhears Bilbo's report of Smaug's vulnerability and tells Bard, a Lake-town resident. Smaug wreaks havoc on the town, until Bard shoots an arrow into the chink in Smaug's armour, killing the dragon.

When the dwarves take possession of the mountain, Bilbo finds the Arkenstone, the most-treasured heirloom of Thorin's family, and hides it away. The Wood-elves and Lake-men request compensation for Lake-town's destruction and settlement of old claims on the treasure. When Thorin refuses to give them anything, they besiege the mountain. However, Thorin manages to send a message to his kinfolk in the Iron Hills and reinforces his position. Bilbo slips out and gives the Arkenstone to the besiegers, hoping to head off a war. When they offer the jewel to Thorin in exchange for treasure, Bilbo reveals how they obtained it. Thorin, furious at what he sees as betrayal, banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable when Dain, Thorin's second cousin, arrives with an army of dwarf warriors.

Gandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn, who fights in his bear form and kills the goblin general, do they win the Battle of Five Armies. Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies.

Bilbo accepts only a small portion of his share of the treasure, having no want or need for more, but still returns home a very wealthy hobbit roughly a year and a month after he first left. Years later, he writes the story of his adventures.


## The Lord of the Rings


### The fellowship of the ring

The hobbits originate in a migration from the east. They live in the Shire and like to smoke pipe-weed. 

Book I: The Ring Sets Out

Gandalf proves that Frodo's Ring is the One Ring by throwing it into Frodo's fireplace, revealing the hidden text of the Rhyme of the Rings.
Bilbo celebrates his eleventy-first (111th) birthday and leaves the Shire suddenly, passing the Ring to Frodo Baggins, his cousin[d] and heir. Neither Hobbit is aware of the Ring's origin, but Gandalf (a wizard) suspects it is a Ring of Power. Seventeen years later, in "The Shadow of the Past", Gandalf confirms to Frodo that the Ring is the powerfully seductive Ruling Ring lost by the Dark Lord Sauron long ago and counsels Frodo to take it away from the Shire. Gandalf leaves, promising to return by Frodo's birthday and accompany Frodo on his journey, but fails to do so.

Frodo sets out on foot, offering a cover story of moving to a little house in the village of Crickhollow, accompanied by his gardener Sam Gamgee and Frodo's cousin Pippin Took. They are pursued by mysterious Black Riders, but meet a passing group of Elves led by Gildor Inglorion, whose singing to Elbereth wards off the Riders. The Hobbits spend the night with them, then take an evasive shortcut the next day, and arrive at the farm of Farmer Maggot, who takes them to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friend Merry Brandybuck. When they reach the house at Crickhollow, Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on travelling with Frodo and Sam.

They decide to try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest. Merry and Pippin are trapped by Old Man Willow, an ancient tree-spirit who controls much of the forest, but are rescued by Tom Bombadil. Leaving the refuge of Tom's house, they get lost in a fog and are caught by a barrow-wight in a barrow on the downs, but Frodo, awakening from the barrow-wight's spell, calls Tom Bombadil, who frees them and equips them with ancient swords from the barrow-wight's hoard.

The Hobbits reach the village of Bree, where they encounter a Ranger named Strider. The innkeeper gives Frodo a letter from Gandalf written three months before which identifies Strider as a friend. Knowing the riders will attempt to seize the party, Strider guides the Hobbits through the wilderness toward the Elven sanctuary of Rivendell. On the way, the group stops at Weathertop, a hill. While there, they are again attacked, though by only five of the nine Black Riders. Their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed blade. After fighting them off, Strider treats Frodo with the herb athelas, and is joined by the Elf Glorfindel, who has been searching for the party. Glorfindel rides with Frodo, now deathly ill, toward Rivendell. The Black Riders pursue Frodo, but when they enter the Ford of Bruinen, they are swept away by flood waters summoned by Elrond.

Book II: The Ring Goes South

Frodo recovers in Rivendell under Elrond's care. Gandalf informs Frodo that the Black Riders are the Nazgûl, Men from ancient times enslaved by Rings of Power to serve Sauron. The Council of Elrond discusses the history of Sauron and the Ring. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, the heir of Isildur. Isildur had cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand in the battle ending the Second Age, but refused to destroy it, claiming it for himself. The Ring had been lost when Isildur was killed, finally ending up in Bilbo's possession after his meeting with Gollum, described in The Hobbit. Gandalf reports that the chief wizard, Saruman, has betrayed them and is now working to become a power in his own right. Gandalf was captured by him, but escaped, explaining why he had failed to return to meet Frodo as he had promised.

The Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed, but that can be done only by sending it to the fire of Mount Doom in Mordor where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself. Elrond, with the advice of Gandalf, chooses companions for him. The Fellowship of the Ring consists of nine walkers who set out on the quest to destroy the One Ring, in opposition to the nine Black Riders: Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took; Gandalf; the Men Aragorn and Boromir, son of the Steward of Gondor; the Elf Legolas; and the Dwarf Gimli. The Fellowship thus represents the Free Peoples of the West – Elves, Dwarves, Men, and Hobbits, assisted by a Wizard.

After a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains over the Redhorn Pass, the Fellowship take the perilous path through the Mines of Moria. They learn that Balin, one of the Dwarves who accompanied Bilbo in The Hobbit, and his colony of Dwarves were killed by Orcs. After surviving an attack, they are pursued by Orcs and a Balrog, an ancient fire demon from a prior Age. Gandalf confronts the Balrog, and both of them fall into the abyss of Moria. The others escape and find refuge in the timeless Elven forest of Lothlórien, where they are counselled by the Lady Galadriel. Before they leave, Galadriel tests their loyalty, and gives them individual, magical gifts to help them on their quest. She allows Frodo and Sam to look into her fountain, the Mirror of Galadriel, to see unexplained visions of the past and the present, and possibly unreal glimpses of the future. She refuses to take the Ring Frodo offers her, knowing that it would master her.

Galadriel's husband Celeborn gives the Fellowship boats, elven cloaks, and waybread (Lembas), and they travel down the River Anduin to the hill of Amon Hen. There, Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, but immediately regrets it after Frodo puts on the Ring and disappears. Frodo chooses to go alone to Mordor, but Sam, guessing what he intends, intercepts him as he tries to take a boat across the river, and goes with him.


### The two towers

Book III: The Treason of Isengard

A party of large Orcs, Uruk-hai, sent by Saruman, and other Orcs sent by Sauron and led by Grishnákh, attack the Fellowship. Boromir tries to protect Merry and Pippin from the Orcs, but they kill him and capture the two hobbits. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to pursue the Orcs taking Merry and Pippin to Saruman. In the kingdom of Rohan, the Orcs are killed by Riders of Rohan, led by Éomer. Merry and Pippin escape into Fangorn Forest, where they are befriended by Treebeard, the oldest of the tree-like Ents. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas track the hobbits to Fangorn. There they unexpectedly meet Gandalf, resurrected from the dead.

Gandalf explains that he killed the Balrog. He was also killed in the fight, but was sent back to Middle-earth to complete his mission. He is clothed in white and is now Gandalf the White, for he has taken Saruman's place as the chief of the wizards. Gandalf assures his friends that Merry and Pippin are safe. Together they ride to Edoras, capital of Rohan. Gandalf frees Théoden, King of Rohan, from the influence of Saruman's spy Gríma Wormtongue. Théoden musters his fighting strength and rides with his men to the ancient fortress of Helm's Deep, while Gandalf departs to seek help from Treebeard.

Meanwhile, the Ents, roused by Merry and Pippin from their peaceful ways, attack and destroy Isengard, Saruman's stronghold, and flood it, trapping the wizard in the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf convinces Treebeard to send an army of Huorns to Théoden's aid. He brings an army of Rohirrim to Helm's Deep, and they defeat the Orcs, who flee into the forest of Huorns, never to be seen again. Gandalf, Théoden, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli ride to Isengard, and are surprised to find Merry and Pippin relaxing amidst the ruins. Gandalf offers Saruman a chance to turn away from evil. When Saruman refuses to listen, Gandalf strips him of his rank and most of his powers. After Saruman leaves, Wormtongue throws down a hard round object to try to kill Gandalf. It misses and Pippin picks it up; Gandalf swiftly takes it, but Pippin steals it in the night. It is revealed to be a palantír, a seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with Sauron, and that Sauron used to ensnare him. Pippin begins to be entranced by its power. While Gandalf sleeps, Pippin examines the palantír, inadvertently causing Sauron to see him; as Pippin is a hobbit, Sauron believes Pippin has the One Ring. Gandalf is awoken by the commotion and is able to save the incapacitated Pippin. Gandalf immediately rides for Minas Tirith, the chief city of Gondor, taking Pippin with him.

Book IV: The Ring Goes East

Frodo and Sam, heading for Mordor to destroy the One Ring, struggle through the barren hills and cliffs of the Emyn Muil. They become aware they are being watched and tracked; on a moonlit night they capture Gollum, who has followed them from Moria. Frodo makes Gollum swear to serve him, as Ringbearer, and asks him to guide them to Mordor. Gollum leads them across the Dead Marshes. Sam overhears Gollum debating with his alter ego, Sméagol, whether to break his promise and steal the Ring.

They find that the Black Gate of Mordor is too well guarded to pass through, so instead they travel south through the land of Ithilien to a secret pass that Gollum knows. On the way, they are captured by rangers led by Faramir, Boromir's younger brother, and brought to the secret fastness of Henneth Annûn. Unlike his brother, Faramir resists the temptation to seize the Ring and, disobeying standing orders to arrest strangers found in Ithilien, releases them.

Gollum – who is torn between his loyalty to Frodo and his desire for the Ring – guides the hobbits to the pass of Cirith Ungol, but leads them into the lair of the great spider Shelob in the tunnels there. Frodo holds up the gift given to him in Lothlórien: the Phial of Galadriel, which holds the light of Eärendil's star. The light drives Shelob away, and Frodo and Sam are able to get through the pass safely. However, after they leave the pass, Shelob appears and attacks Frodo; before he can help his master, Sam is attacked by Gollum. After fighting off Gollum, Sam picks up Frodo's sword, Sting; and the Phial. He seriously wounds and drives off Shelob, but after the fight, he finds Frodo unresponsive. Believing him to be dead, Sam takes the Ring to continue the quest alone. Before Sam gets far, however, Orcs find Frodo; Sam overhears them and learns that Frodo is still alive.


### The return of the king

Book V: The War of the Ring

Sauron sends a great army against Gondor. Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor of the attack, while Théoden musters the Rohirrim to ride to Gondor's aid. Minas Tirith is besieged; the Lord of the Nazgûl uses a spell-wound battering ram to destroy the city's gates. Denethor, deceived by Sauron, falls into despair. He burns himself alive on a pyre; Pippin and Gandalf rescue his son Faramir from the same fate.

Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas, Gimli, and the Rangers of the North, takes the Paths of the Dead to recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, oathbreakers who are bound by an ancient curse which denies them rest until they fulfil their oath to fight for the King of Gondor. Aragorn unleashes the Army of the Dead on the Corsairs of Umbar invading southern Gondor. With that threat eliminated, Aragorn uses the Corsairs' ships to transport the men of southern Gondor up the Anduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in time to turn the tide of battle. Théoden's niece Éowyn, who joined the army in disguise, kills the Lord of the Nazgûl with help from Merry; both are wounded. Together, Gondor and Rohan defeat Sauron's army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, though at great cost; Théoden is among the dead.

Aragorn enters Minas Tirith and heals Faramir, Éowyn, and Merry. He leads an army of men from Gondor and Rohan, marching through Ithilien to the Black Gate to distract Sauron from his true danger. At the Battle of the Morannon, his army is vastly outnumbered.

Book VI: The End of the Third Age

Meanwhile, Sam rescues Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor. When they reach the edge of the Cracks of Doom, Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer. He claims it for himself and puts it on. Gollum suddenly reappears. He struggles with Frodo and bites off Frodo's finger with the Ring still on it. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his footing and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power forever. All he created collapses, the Nazgûl perish, and his armies are thrown into such disarray that Aragorn's forces emerge victorious.

Aragorn is crowned King of Arnor and Gondor, and weds Arwen, daughter of Elrond. Théoden is buried and Éomer is crowned King of Rohan. His sister Éowyn is engaged to marry Faramir, now Steward of Gondor and Prince of Ithilien. Galadriel, Celeborn, and Gandalf meet and say farewell to Treebeard, and to Aragorn.

The four hobbits make their way back to the Shire, only to find that it has been taken over by men directed by "Sharkey" (whom they later discover to be Saruman). The hobbits, led by Merry, raise a rebellion and scour the Shire of Sharkey's evil. Gríma Wormtongue turns on Saruman and kills him in front of Bag End, Frodo's home. He is killed in turn by hobbit archers. Merry and Pippin are celebrated as heroes. Sam marries Rosie Cotton and uses his gifts from Galadriel to help heal the Shire. But Frodo is still wounded in body and spirit, having borne the Ring for so long. A few years later, in the company of Bilbo and Gandalf, Frodo sails from the Grey Havens west over the Sea to the Undying Lands to find peace.
