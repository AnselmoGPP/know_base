## Definitions

Consciousness is not easy to define, and not everybody agree on its definition. Some definitions (retrieved 7/19/2025) are:

- Merriam-Webster:

  - Quality or state of being aware especially of something within oneself.
  - Awareness: Quality or state of being aware: knowledge and understanding that something is happening or exists.
  - State of being characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, and thought.
  - Mind: Element or complex of elements in an individual that feels, perceives, thinks, wills, and especially reasons.

- Cambridge dictionary:

  - State of being awake, thinking, and knowing what is happening around you.
  - State of being awake, aware of what is around you, and able to think.

- Oxford English dictionary:

  - Faculty or capacity from which awareness of thought, feeling, and volition and of the external world arises. Also, the exercise of this.
  - The aspect of the mind made up of operations which are known to the subject.
  - Totality of the impressions, thoughts, and feelings, which make up a person's sense of self or define a person's identity.

- Real Academia Española (definitions translated to English):

  - Ability of some living beings to recognise and relate to the surrounding reality.
  - Psychic faculty by which a subject perceives himself in the world.

- Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy:

  - Philosophers have used the term ‘consciousness’ for four main topics: knowledge in general, intentionality, introspection (and the knowledge it specifically generates) and phenomenal experience. Introspection and phenomenality seem independent, or dissociable, although this is controversial.
    - Introspection: Something within one’s mind is ‘introspectively conscious’ just in case one introspects it (or is poised to do so). Introspection is often thought to deliver one’s primary knowledge of one’s mental life.
    - Phenomenal experience: Experience or other mental entity where there is ‘something it is like’ for one to have it. The clearest examples are: perceptual experiences, such as tastings and seeings; bodily-sensational experiences, such as those of pains, tickles and itches; imaginative experiences, such as those of one’s own actions or perceptions; and streams of thought, as in the experience of thinking ‘in words’ or ‘in images’.

Definitions I will be using:

- **Consciousness**: Subjective and aware experience of perceptions, feelings, thoughts, and actions.

  - Feelings: Sensations (tastes, colours, pain, pleasure, softness...) and emotions (happiness, sorrow, joy...).

- **Mind**: Individual consciousness. Part or faculty of an individual by which one feels, perceives, thinks, remembers, desires, and imagines.

- **Phenomenal world**: The 3-dimensional world where we are and that is a huge source of phenomena.








The only thing you can be sure is of your own existence. There is no other evidence of consciousness.

Unconsciousness

baby, animals... are conscious?


- Mind, or at least, an aspect of it.
- Any kind of cognition, experience, feeling, or perception.









- Subjective experience.
- Consciousness is the sentience or awareness of internal or external existence. It involves any kind of experience, cognition (introspection, thought, imagination, volition), feeling or perception.
- Awareness or perception of:
  - an inward psychological or spiritual fact: intuitively perceived knowledge of something in one’s inner self
  - an inward awareness of an external object, state or fact
  - concern, interest
- State or activity characterized by sensation, emotion, volition or thought. Mind in the broadest sense. Something in nature that is distinguished from physical.
- Totality in psychology of sensations, perceptions, ideas, attitudes and feelings of which an individual or a group is aware at any given time or within a particular time span

As an example, when somebody gets hurt, his body responds executing some physical actions (usually with the aim of healing him and making him try to avoid to be hurt again) involving nerve impulses (electrical signals in the nervous system), brain rewiring, muscle contraction, cry, etc. All these responses are physical. However, something else is happening that no one can see: the feeling of pain. This cannot be seen, but only experienced by the subject who was harmed.

## Introduction

The only thing I can be sure that exists is myself (my mind), whatever I am. As Descartes said, "_Cogito, ergo sum_". I know I exist because I am thinking and I am conscious about it. To know this I need not only to think, but also to be conscious of my own thinking. I also realize the existence of time, where I am embedded, since my own thoughts flow one after another. My senses give me information about an outer world, but they can lie at me, so they cannot be trusted, and thus I cannot be sure of the outer world. As an example, in a dream, or in a simulation, my senses send me information that is not real but that can feel very real. Reality is everything in existence, everything that is not imaginary or abstract. I am real, but I don't know what else is real.

So far, I don't have a lot to work with, so let's see what my senses tell me about the outer world. Out there I discover a three-dimensional world where I have a body. I learn how my body works and how to control it. I also discover that there are other individuals similar to me. However, I can never be sure that they have consciousness since I can only experience me, I can never experience others. However, since they behave similar to me, I assume they have.

Since I started to exist, my senses have provided me with lots of data. My body has different sensors (senses) that capture data from the world, like light (electromagnetic radiation), sound (air vibrations), odour (volatilized chemical compounds), and more. This data is transformed into electrical signals, which are sent through the nervous system to the brain. But they were too many signals, so it was very difficult to extract any useful information from them. However, over time, I started to see some patterns, from which I generated abstractions (general rules and concepts derived from a set of specific elements). Abstractions helped me a lot in simplifying, understanding, predicting, and navigating the world better.

At the beginning, I couldn't even think or reason, because I knew nothing about anything, and my mind was empty. But, as I learned more and more about the world, I extracted general rules (concepts, logic, facts...) that helped me think better. However, although these rules work acceptably well in the current world, they could be invalid and useless in a different world.

My body is part of the world, so I have also learned about it. It's interesting to see that my mind doesn't appear to be an independent entity. Instead, it is extremely correlated to the machinery at work in my body, especially my brain. Whatever happens to my brain appears to have a direct effect into my conscious experience. For example, when my body releases certain hormones, my mood changes (dopamine makes me feel good, and endorphins relieve my pain); and damage in the brain can make me forget things and change my personality.

It appears that my mind "emerges" from my physical brain. However, this doesn't make sense to me. The human body has been studied very deeply and we know now that there is no magic in it, it's just a very complex machine that works fine (until it gets broken over time). Since all the brain mechanics have physical explanation, it appears that this machine should be able to work fine even without the existence of consciousness in it. This arises some questions:

- Why is there consciousness?
- Does it exists or it's just an illusion?
- Would our brain behave the same with an without consciousness? In other words, does it have any effect on our brain, or it just follows what the brain dictates as an spectator that flows with the physical world without affecting it?

Consider the following question: __Does a human with no consciousness wonder about consciousness (like we do)?__ What do you think? Each possible answer has big implications.

- __No__, he cannot wonder about what he doesn't even know or experience. This means that:
  - Our consciousness is real, because we wonder about it. If unconscious entities don't wonder about consciousness, we must be conscious because we wonder about it.
  - Our mind has an effect on our brain in the physical world, because our mind makes our brain wonder about consciousness, instead of just having no effect.
- __Yes__, it is not real. This means that:
  - Consciousness is extremely likely to be an illusion.
  - Our brain works without being affected by any consciousness.

Assuming that consciousness is real, it really has an effect on the physical world because it can affect our behaviour. It is not something that just has not effect in our brain. We would behave differently without consciousness. Thus, consciousness play a role in our brain instead of just following the brain's actions. If its mere existence modifies the brain's behaviour, everything our mind experience has the potential to change our brain's behaviour in the physical world.

Assuming consciousness is an illusion, we are most probably hallucinating our consciousness. Our brain is not being affected by any consciousness. Only physical world elements are at play here.





Reality (brain?)











## Neural networks

The nervous system is specially interesting since it controls the whole body. In vertebrates, the nervous system is made of:

- __Central nervous system (CNS)__: Made of:
  - __Brain__: Receives information from the sensory nervous system, processes that information (thought, cognition, and intelligence) and coordinates motor control (muscle activity and endocrine system). 
  - __Spinal cord__: Transmits motor signals from brain to body, and from sensory nerves to brain; coordinates many reflexes, can independently control reflexes, and controls motor instructions for rhythmic movements (like walking).
- __Peripheral nervous system (PNS)__: Nerves connecting the CNS to every other part of the body. Some transmit signals from the brain (motor nerves), while others transmit information from the body (sensory nerves). Two PNS subsystems:
  - __Somatic__: Links brain and spinal cord to skeletal muscles under conscious control, and to sensory receptors in the skin.
  - __Autonomic__: Operates internal organs, smooth muscle and glands. It's a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates bodily functions. Subdivided into:
    - __Sympathetic__: Activated in emergencies to mobilize energy.
    - __Parasympathetic__: Activated in a relaxed state.
    - __Enteric__: Controls the gastrointestinal system.

The nervous system is made of neurons. Neurons can send signals (as electrochemical impulses) along axons (thin fibers), which can be transmitted to neighbouring cells or cause neurotransmitters to be released. A cell receiving such signal may be excited, inhibited, or modulated. The connections between neurons can form neural pathways (just for neurotransmission), neural circuits (set of neurons interconnected to carry out a specific function when activated), or larger networks (generates an organism's perception of the world and determines its behaviour). The CNS sends signals from one cell to another, or from one part of the body to another, and receives feedback.

The nervous system could be seen as a very intricate network of cables that connect all parts of the body with each other. These cables go through many nodes distributed across the network. The bigger bunch of cables is the brain. The senses and internal organs send signals through these cables. Signals are used to activate certain mechanisms of the body (like muscle contraction). Signals follow different paths and are modified when passing through nodes. Furthermore, the cables can modify their connections to create new paths and delete old ones. Over time, this network configures itself in a way that allows the body to work properly. Signals from the senses and within the body are distributed, redirected, and modulated in a way that the appropriate signals reach the appropriate parts of the body to activate the appropriate reactions.





My nervous system 


continually transmits and receives electrical signals. The senses transmit signals to the brain, where these signals are modified

I learned how the senses translate world's data into electrical signals that go to my brain. 




Is fundamental or abstraction?

Abstractions "exist", but are not fundamental.


## Introduction 2

### Thomas Nagel

Reductionist theories doesn't explain consciousness. Perhaps a new theoretical form is needed.

Conscious experience is a widespread phenomenon. An organism has conscious experience at all means. There's something it is like to be that organism (subjective character of experience), which is not captured by the reductive analyses of the mental, making it not analysable. Every subjective phenomenon is connected with a single point of view, and it should be taken into account by a theory of consciousness.

Most bats perceive the external world primarily by sonar (echolocation). They emit high-frequency shrieks and detect their reflections from nearby objects. Their brains use this information to recognize their surroundings, similarly to how we use vision. While bat sonar is a form of perception, it's not similar to any of our senses, so it's not subjectively like anything we can experience or imagine.

I cannot imagine what it is like for a bat to be a bat because I'm restricted to the resources of my own mind, which are inadequate to the task. My experiences are not anything like a bat experiences. Similarly, the subjective character of the experience of a person deaf and blind from birth is not accessible to me, nor is mine to him. Some intelligent alien could not imagine what it is like to be human, and vice versa. 

There may exist facts that humans can never represent or comprehend (humanly inaccessible facts) because our structure doesn't permit us to operate with the required concepts. Reflection on what it is to be a bat seems to conclude that there are facts that don't consist in the truth of propositions expressible in human language.

The point of view is a type. Very similar individuals could understand the quality of the other's experience. But the more different they are, the less success to understand each other's experience.

Regarding the mind-body problem, if the facts of experience are accessible only from one point of view, then it's a mystery how the true character of experiences could be revealed in the physical operation of that organism (objective facts).

It may be easier than I thought to transcend inter-species barriers with the aid of imagination. For example, blind people can detect nearby objects by a form of sonar, using vocal clicks or taps of a cane. Perhaps they can imagine roughly what was like to possess the highly refined sonar of a bat. However, my point is not that we cannot know what it is like to be a bat. My point is that even to form a conception of what it is like to be a bat, one must take up the bat's point of view.

Though an alien could understand the rainbow, lighting, or clouds as physical phenomena, he would never be able to understand them as human concepts or their place in our phenomenal world.

In other areas the process of reduction moves towards greater objectivity, a more accurate view of real nature of things. It describes it not in terms of the impressions it makes on our senses, but in terms of its more general effects and of properties detectable by means other than human senses. The less it depends on a human viewpoint, the more objective is our description. Experience itself, however, doesn't fit here. However, we probably won't get closer to the real nature of human experience by leaving behind our human point of view and looking for a description in terms accessible to beings that could not imagine what it was like to be us.



## Questions

- Would I ask about consciousness if I am not conscious?
- If I ask about consciousness, does it means that consciousness exists? Can we ask about things that don't exist?
- Does consciousness ability to affect material world? Maybe collapse wave function?
- Consciousness appears to emerge like economy emerges from sociology, or biology from physics.
- Freedom (determinism, libertarianism, compatibilism) and consciousness are related?
- Sensations are unimaginable until we experience them (such as bat senses).
- Physics just makes predictions, but doesn't interpretate reality (including explaining consciousness).
  - Mathematically modelling a brain is possible? Is there randomness at quantum level that prevents it?
  - We interpretate the world at macro-level because we work with huge abstractions.
  - Is physics/maths all that there is?
  - Consciousness is not needed for the world to work as intended (apparently).
  - We cannot deduce consciousness from physical events. We cannot deduce gravity from physical events, but we assume our theory of gravity to be true because it makes excellent predictions. Thus, a theory of consciousness should predict, given a system, the type of consciousness associated.
- Different levels of consciousness.
- I think, thus I exist (Descartes). Thus, maybe consciousness is the most fundamental thing.
- Anything complex enough develops consciousness?
  - Can a complex automata that behave like people but experience nothing?
- Artificial neural networks
- Physical cerebro affects consciousness. And viceversa? Reality (drugs) can alter consciousness.



### Topics

Defining consciousness / experience
- Questions and purpose of the essay
- Why consciousness is difficult to define? And to provide evidence of it?
Humans are preprogrammed. Try to know about the world in order to make predictions.
We gather information from the world to predict better the outcomes of our actions.
- Consciousness is limited to a small piece of mind activity. Unconsciousness do the rest.
  - Consciousness is for non-routine/new/complex activities?
Neural networks do similar things, including abstractions.



### Do automatas wonder about consciousness?

Artificial neural networks create abstractions of the world. Let's consider a NN that models a real human brain. If NNs have no consciousness and humans do have, both systems would behave differently (NNs wouldn't wonder about consciousness). But if NNs have consciousness, they would behave like a human. 

Let's suppose consciousness is an illusion and humans have no consciousness. Let's call them NPCs (Non-Playable Characters). Would NPCs wonder about consciousness? Initially, we wouldn't expect them to do so. However, we would expect an NPC to ask questions about the world in order to understand it better and be able to navigate through it properly (i.e., be able to make better predictions about the world so it can navigate it better). But he himself is part of the world, so it will also ask questions about himself, and about how his own brain and body works.

Fact: Humans wonder about consciousness.

- If NPCs don't wonder about consciousness > They are behaving different than us because of the presence of consciousness. Thus, they don't have, and humans have.
- If NPCs wonder about consciousness > It might or might not be an illusion. And, if consciousness exists, any system has a degree of consciousness.










Or, alternatively, suposse that there is an automata that behaves in a way that makes it indistinguishable from a human being.


Let's consider an automata that behaves in a way that makes it indistinguishable from a human being. Let's suppose it has no consciousness, no first person experiences. Would it wonder about consciousness

- If he has no consciousness, we would expect him not to do so. In this case, we could say that consciousness is not an illusion because humans wonder about consciousness and automatas doesn't.

But we could expect him to ask questions about the world, in order to understand how it works, which would help him make better predictions about the world and about the outcomes of his own actions.


Would I ask about consciousness if I am not conscious?
