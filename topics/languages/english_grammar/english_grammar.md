- She didn’t __mind__ __waiting__ for so long

Sections that follow:

- to + inf.
- inf.
- gerund
- to + inf./gerund
- verb + (to + inf) / gerund

#### To + inf.

- __Behind these verbs__: afford, agree, appear (seem), attempt, decide, except, fail, forget, help, hope, intend, learn, manage, need, offer, plan, prepare, pretend, promise, propose, refuse, seem, want, wish, would like.

  - Jane learned to swim at the age of 3
  - I have decided to work this summer

- __When the verb is followed by an object__ (verb + object + inf.): advise, allow, ask, enable, encourage, expect, forbid, force, help, invite, order, permit, persuade, prefer, recommend, remind, teach, tell, want, warn, would like.

  - They’ve asked me to help them this afternoon
  - We want them to stay a little bit longer
  - ~~We want that they stay a little bit longer~~

- __Behind adjectives and adverbs:__

  - It is interesting to learn languages

- __Behind “it is/was + adjective + of + noun/pronoun”:__

  - It was very kind of you to help the old lady

- __Behind “adjective + for + object”:__

  - It was very difficult for us to find out the truth

- __With interrogative pronouns__ (all of them may be followed with to + infinitive; except why, which is just followed by an infinitive):

#### Infinitive (without to)

- __Behind__

  - __modal verbs__: can, could, may, might, must, shall, will, should, would, needn’t.

- __Verbs followed by object + infinitive without to__ (let, make):

- __When using “prefer” with 2 actions, we use -ing for both__. The second action may be preceded by the preposition “to” or “rather than”:

### Passive voice

**Structure**: verb “to be” in the same verbal tense than the active verb + participle of main verb

- They __installed__ the central heating yesterday
- The central heating __was__ __installed__ yesterday

|Verbal tense|Active|Pasive|
|:-----------|:-----|:-----|
|Present simple|writes/write|is/are written|
|Present continuous|is/are writing|is/are being written|
|Past simple|wrote|was/were written|
|Past continuous|was/were writing|was/were being written|
|Present perfect|has/have written|has/have been written|
|Past perfect|had written|had been written|
|Future simple|will write|will be written|
|Future perfect|will have written|will have been written|
|Conditional present|would write|would be written|
|Conditional perfect|would have written|would have been written|
|Infinitive present|to write|to be written|
|Infinitive perfect|to have written|to have been written|
|Participle present/gerund|writing|being written|
|Participle perfect|having written|having been written|

Used for talking about somebody/something affected by some action, with emphasis on the action and its object (_The food was cooked quickly_).

The agent, introduced by the word **by**, is the subject of the active verb (_Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci_). But it can be omitted (_The thief was arrested last night (by the police)_) (_My dog was found two days ago_ (by somebody)_).

If the active verb has 2 objects, the indirect object generally becomes the subject of the passive phrase:

- They gave her a lot of money  >  She was given a lot of money (or: a lot of money was given to her)

Some verbs that admit this structure are: _give_, _send_, _show_, _lend_, _ask_, _tell_, _offer_, _order_ and _pay_. But the verbs _ask_ and _tell_ are not usually used in the structure where the direct object becomes the subject of the passive voice (wrong: _A terrible secret was told to me_).

The passive voice can also be used with verbs such as: _believe_, _know_, _report_, _say_, etc.

- _Say_

  - Active: _They say that this monument is emblematic._
  - Passive: _It is said that this monument is emblematic. This monument is said to be emblematic._

- _Believe_

  - Active: _They believe these documents belonged to a German emperor._
  - Passive: _It is believed that these documents belonged to a German emperor. These documents are believed to have belonged to a German emperor._

- _Think_

  - Active: _They thought these people had lived in Nepal._
  - Passive: _It was thought that these people had lived in Nepal. These people were thought to have lived in Nepal._

#### Have/Get something done

**have/get + object + participle:**

- Used in a passive sense to express that somebody does something for us.

  - We are going to have/get our house painted
  - John has his car washed every week
  - He’s had his bike repaired

- “Have” can be used to tell that something unpleasant happened to us.

  - I had my finger bitten during the fight
  - She had her handbag stolen while she was walking.

#### It's time

**It’s time** (three possible structures):

- + to infinitive

  - It’s time to start studying.

- + for + object + to infinitive

  - It’s time for you to start studying.

- + subject + past simple (often used for reproach criticism)

  - It’s time you started to study (ya es hora de que empezaras a estudiar).

Alternatively: **It’s high time / It’s about time** + subject + past simple


### Conditional sentences

#### Type I (probable condition)

Used for describing situations that we think are possible.

- **[If + present simple] + [Future (will + infinitive) / Modal + infinitive / Imperative]**

#### Type II (improbable condition)

Used for describing possible but unlikely situations, or hypothetical or imaginary situations.

- **[If + past simple] + [simple conditional (would/could/might + infinitive)]**   (if + past + would/could/might + infinitive)

  - If they lived in the town centre, they would go to the cinema more often (si vivieran en el centro, irian al cine más a menudo)
  - If I could, I would live in the country (si pudiera, viviría en el campo)
  - If I was/were taller, I could reach the top shelf (si fuera más alto, llegaría hasta el estante superior)

Word _were__ can be used with the first and third singular person of verb _to be_, though _was_ is more frequent. However, in "_if I were you_", the word _were_ cannot be replaced with _was_ (_if I were you, I would wear the coat_).

#### Type III (impossible condition)

Used for describing past situations that never happened.

- **[If + past perfect (had + past participle)] + [compound conditional (would/could/might have + participle)]**   (if + Past perfect + would/could/might Present perfect)

  - ~~If he would have cheated in the exam, the teacher would have punished him~~

#### I wish/if only

Used for expressing wishes, or regreting something that happened in the past. Both forms can be used interchangeably, but _if only_ is used for emphasis.

- **I wish/If only + past simple** (for a present situation)

  - _I wish I had a car!_ (¡Ojalá tuviera coche!)
  - _If only I could cook well!_ (¡Ojalá supiera cocinar bien!)

- Word **were** can be used for more formality

  - _I wish I were taller! (¡Ojalá fuera más alto!)
  - _If only he were more intelligent! (¡Ojalá fuera él más inteligente!)
  
- **I wish/If only + Past perfect** (for a past situation)

  - _I wish it hadn't rained! (¡Ojalá no hubiera llovido!)
  - _If only you had come with us!_ (¡Ojalá hubieras venido con nosotros!)

- **I wish/If only + would + infinitive** (for complaining about the present about something that is always happening)

  - _I wish you would stop complaining! (¡Ojalá dejaras de quejarte!: siempre te estás quejando, pero deseo que dejes de hacerlo)

#### Other conditional conjunctions

- **Unless**: It can be often used as an alternative to _if... not_. It's often used in conditional sentences of type I.

  - I won't wear my raincoat unless it rains
  - I'll accept their offer unless they pay very little

- **Provided (that) / Providing (that) / As long as / On condition (that)**: Same meaning as _if_ but emphasizing the condition.

  - You can play in the living-room __as long as__ you're quiet
  - I'll lend you the money __on condition__ (that) you give it back to me next week

  
### Relative clauses

#### Relative pronouns

- **For persons**:

  - As subject: **who, that**

    - Graham Bell was the person who/that invented the telephone
    - These are the doctors who/that saved my life

  - As object: **whom, who, that**

    - The children(whom/who/that) you saw in the school canteen are my students

- **For things**: **which, that**

  - I don't like the books which/that are on this shelf
  - That is in the film which/that was awarded so many Oscars

- **Possessive**: **whose**

  - That is the girl whose father won a magnificent prize

- **Place**: **where**

  - Madrid is the capital where you can visit the Prado Museum
  - Birmingham is the city where Jim was born

#### Defining relative clauses (oraciones de relativo especificativas)

They define the place, person, or object the speaker is referring to.

- **As subject:**

  - The person who/that helps a doctor is called a nurse
  - The insect which/that bit her was a mosquito
  - That's the man whose family is on holidays

- **As object**:

  - The soldier (whom/who/that) we saw at the station have just come from the war
  - The tomatoes (which/that) they've bought are very ripe
  - The lady whose overcoat you stained yesterday is very upset

Notes:

- They don't have commas separating the relative clause from the rest.
- The relative pronoun can be omitted when it works as object, direct or indirect, or as prepositional complement of the relative clause. In this case, the preposition goes behind the verb or direct object if it exists.

  - Juan is the man we were talking to in Seville
  - Pam is the girl we had lunch with

- _That_ can replace _who_ or _which_.
- _Whom_ is the object form corresponding to _who_. It's usually used in formal and written English. In all other cases _who_ and _that_ are used.

  - Juan is the man to whom we were talking in Seville
  - Pam is the girl with whom we had lunch

- _What_ can also be used as relative pronoun meaning "lo que".

  - She offered us what she had (ella nos ofreció lo que tenía)
  - She offered us all that she had (ella nos ofreció todo lo que tenía)

#### Non-defining relative clauses (oraciones de relativo explicativas)

They provide additional information to that presented by the main clause, but it could be omitted without affecting the meaning of the sentence. They usually go between commas when they occur inside the sentence.

- Brad Pitt, who is an American actor, has starred in many important films
- My computer, which I bough at a reduced price, isn't working very well
- Melanie Griffith, whose mother starred in Hitchcock's film "The birds", is married to Antonio Banderas
- Lisa was born in Hove, where her family still lives (a relative clause at the end of the sentence just needs one comma)

Notes:

- Relative pronouns can never be omitted here.
- _Who_ or _which_ cannot be replaced with the relative pronoun _that_.
- _Which_ can be used instead of a complete sentence.

  - They went on holiday in November, which surprised us a lot

#### Other notes

An infinitive can be used behind _the last_, _the only_, _the first_, _the second_, etc. instead of a relative clause.

- I was the last person to arrive / I was the last person who arrived
- Mike was the only student to pass the exam / Mike was the only student who passed the exam

Structure **[It is / was + noun (or pronoun) + relative clause]** is used to give emphasis to the subject of the relative clause.

- It is always Rob who pays for the drinks
- It was my father who saved the baby


### Subordinate clauses

#### Cause and effect

**Subordinate clauses of cause and effect** (oraciones subordinadas causales): They are introduced with conjunctions _because_, _as_ and _since_, but they are not interchangeable.

- **Because** is used when answering to a question:

  - _Why are they so happy? Because they've won the lottery_.

- **not because... but because**:

  - _He learned Italian not because he wanted to live in Italy but because he wanted to teach it_.

- In the rest of cases, _because_ and _as_ can be used interchangeably, though _as_ is more frequent when the clause appears first:

  - _He managed to lift the heavy box because/as he was very strong_.
  - _As/Because he was very strong, he managed to lift the box_.

- **Since** can be used in the previous example:

  - _Since he was very strong, he managed to lift the box_.

- When the cause is clear or is know beforehand, using _as_ or _since_ is more frequent:

  - _As/Since you like driving, you could drive_.

- Cause and consequence is usually expressed with _because_ and _so_:

  - _I went to bed because there was nothing interesting on TV_.
  - _There was nothing interesting on TV, so I went to bed_.

- Consequence can also be expressed with _therefore_, _consequently_, _as a result_.

#### Purpose

**Subordinate clauses of purpose** (oraciones subordinadas finales): For explaining why somebody does something.

- **To + infinitive** ("para + infinitivo"): For explaining why somebody does something. This can only be used when the subject of the main verb is the same as the subject of the clause of the infinitive.

  - I went to the kitchen __to prepare__ a milkshake
  - ~~I went to the kitchen for to prepare a sandwich~~

- **In order to / so as to + infinitive** ("a fin de", "con el fin de"): Same meaning as the previous structure, but more formal.

  - We worked hard during the summer __in order to__ / __so as to__ buy a new car

- **So (that) / in order that + clause**: Express purpose both if the subject of both clauses is the same, and if the subject is different. These conjunctions are usually followed with _can_, _will_, _could_, _should_, _would_ + infinitive.

  - Today I'll make dinner __so (that)__ / __in order that__ you can rest

#### Time

**Subordinate clauses of time** (oraciones subordinadas de tiempo): For talking about the past, the future, and the relation between two actions occurring at different times.

- They are introduced with the next conjunctions: after, as, as long as, as soon as, before, by the time (that), since, the moment (that), till, until, when, whenever, while.

- Generally, when the subordinate clause appears in front of the main clause, both are separated with a comma.

- Types of temporal clauses:

  - Referring to the future: Use a present simple clause behind conjunctions after, as soon as, before, by the time, the moment, till, until, when.

    - I'll do my homework when I get home
    - We won't go out until it stops raining
    - ~~I'll do my homework when I'll get home~~

  - Referring to the past: We can use a past simple clause behind the conjunction.

    - I ran out when I heard the noise

  - Emphasize that an action, expressed with the time clause, is completely finished before another action starts: We can use present perfect or past perfect with after, as soon as, till/until, when.

    - Don't leave the house until it has stopped raining

  - Express that the action wasn't finished before another action started: We can use present perfect or past perfect with _before_.

    - They wanted the house before I had decided to sell it

  - It's + (time period) + since + subordinate clause with verb in past simple.

    - It's a long time since we (last) went to a concert
    - Alternatively: We haven't been to a concert for a long time

#### Contrast

**Subordinate clauses of contrast** (oraciones subordinadas concesivas): They express contrast and opposition between ideas. They can presented the following structures:

- **Although/Though** (aunque): Sentence's order can change. We can use "even though" to emphasise the contrast.

  - Although/Though it was sunny, the temperature was very low

### Indirect style

Used for communicating to someone what another person has said, without using the exact words.

- If the verb introducing the indirect style is in present, present perfect, or future, verb tenses don't change.

  - They say: 'We live near here.' / They say (that) they live near here
  - He says: 'I don't want to study.' / He says (that) he doesn't want to study

- If the verb introducing the indirect style is in past, some changes are produced:

  - **Declarative sentences:**

    - __Present simple:__ I work from 9 to 5 / __Past simple:__ He said (that) he worked from 9 to 5
    - __Present continuous:__ I'm watching TV / __Past continuous:__ He said (that) he was watching TV
    - __Present perfect:__ We've just come back / __Past perfect:__ They said they had just come back
    - __Past simple:__ I spoke to them at the door / __Past perfect:__ He said he ad spoken to them at the door

    - **Modal verbs changes**:

      - I __can__ sing very well / He said (that) he __could__ sing very well
      - I __will__ open the window / He said (that) he __would__ open the window
      - You __must__ be more responsible / He said (that) I __had to__ be more responsible
      - I __have (got) to__ finish a report / He said (that) he __had to__ finish a report
      - It __may__ rain / He said (that) it __might__ rain
      - Note: Other modal verbs doesn't change.

    - The verb introducing the direct and indirect style is usually _say_. In the direct style, when the verb is followed with an object of person, we can use _say to_ or _tell_.

      - `I'm still a bit dizzy,` he said to me
      - `I'm not going out,` he told me
      - ~~`I'm still a bit dizzy,` he said me~~

    - However, in the indirect style only _told_ is used: _He told me he was still a bit dizzy_.

    - Possessive pronouns and adjectives of first person change to third.

      - She said, `I can't find my purse.` / She said (that) she couldn't find her purse.

    - Pronoun _you_ changes to _I_ or _we_.

      - He said, `You are busy.` / He said I was busy.
      - He said to us, `You look sad.` / He told us we looked sad.
      - He said, `You look sad, Carol.` / `He told Carol she looked sad.`

    - Other expressions that change (direct / indirect):

      - this > that
      - here > there
      - today > that day
      - yesterday > the day before / the previous day
      - tomorrow > the next day / the following day
      - tonight > that night
      - tomorrow morning > the following morning
      - yesterday afternoon > the previous afternoon
      - next week/month/year > the following week/month/year
      - last week/month/year > a week/month/year before

  - **Indirect orders (reported commands):**

    - A direct style order always uses the imperative. An indirect style order use this structure: **Subject + introductory verb (told, asked, advised, warned) + object + (not) to + infinitive**
      
      - Positive order: He said to Gill, 'Leave the door open.' > He told (asked) Gill to leave the door open.
      - Negative order: He said to me, 'Don't panic.' > He told (asked) me not to panic.

  - **Indirect interrogative sentences (reported questions)**: 

    - They can be introduced with verbs _ask_, _know_, _want to know_, _wonder_, _not know_.

    - Verb tenses changes are the same as those for indirect declarative sentences.

    - **Wh- questions**: Words order of the original question change to the declarative sentence order. Positions: Interrogative pronoun > Subject > Verb.

      - He said, 'When did you start smoking?' > He asked/wondered/wanted to know/didn't know when I had started smoking.
      - ~~He asked where did you start smoking~~

      - He said, 'Can I sit down?' > He asked me if/whether he could sit down.

### Reporting verbs (Verbos introductores del estilo indirecto)

Some verbs can indicate the intention of the speaker (suggestion, apology, offering, promise, rejection...). Next, we'll see the most common verbs and their syntactical structure.

**Sentence introduced with _that_**: _admit_, _agree_, _claim_, _complain_, _explain_, _insist_, _promise_, _remind_, _reply_, _say_, _suggest_, _tell_ (+ object), _warn_.

- They promised (that) they would buy a present for her birthday
- She suggested we should go out for a walk

Verbs _promise_ and _agree_ can be followed with **to + infinitive**: _They promised to buy a present for her birthday_.

**Verb + object + to + infinitive** (verbo + que + subjuntivo): Used with _ask_, _advise_, _invite_, _order_, _tell_, _warn_.

- The teacher asked me to be quiet

**Verbs ending with -ing**: _accuse someone of_, _admit_, _apologise for_, _insist on_, _recommend_, _suggest_.

- He apologised to me for being rude

**Inversion of terms in a sentence**: Inversion of auxiliar verb and subject not only happens with interrogative sentences.

- With _so_, _neither_, and _nor_ in short answers. If there's no auxiliar in the sentence, we use _do_, _does_, or _did_.

  - I work in an office > So do I
  - We don't drink > Neither/Nor do we
  - I've got a monolingual dictionary > So have I

- **In negative expressions**. When we put a negative adverb or negative adverbial expression at the beginning of a sentence, the order of the subject and verb is inverted, using auxiliars _do_, _does_, _did_, if the sentence doesn't contain any auxiliar verb. Most common structures:

  - **Hardly + past perfect (+ object) + when + past simple**
    - Hardly had we left home when it began to rain (En cuanto salimos de casa, empezó a llover)

  - **Other negative sentences** usually used at the beginning of the sentence and that also require inversion are: _at no time_ (en ningún momento), _in no way_ (de ninguna manera), _never_ (never), _on no account_ (bajo ningún concepto), _scarcely_ (apenas), _seldom_ (pocas veces), _under no circumstances_ (bajo ninguna circunstancia).

### Phrasal verbs

Some verbs change meaning when we add prepositions (prepositional verb) or adverbs (adverbial verbs).

**Phrasal verb types:**

- **Verb + preposition (transitive prepositional verb)**: The object usually goes behind the preposition. Replacing the noun with a personal pronoun, the object position doesn't change.
  - May likes __looking at__ the stars
  - Don't __listen to__ him
  - They __waited for__ us for a long time
  - She __listened to__ her father very carefully
  - She __listened to__ him very carefully

- **Verb + adverbial particle (transitive adverbial verb)**: The direct object (if it's a noun) can go behind or in front of the adverbial particle. However, if we replace the noun with a personal pronoun, it can only be placed between the verb and the adverbial particle.
  - Turn down the volume, please
  - The boy took off his shirt
  - The boy took his shirt off
  - The boy took it off

- **Verbs + adverbial particle (intransitive adverbial verb)**:
  - Hurry up! It's getting late
